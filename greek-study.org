  interrogative
      /ˌɪntəˈrɒɡətɪv/
      adjective
      having the force of a question.

  transitive verb
      A verb that entails one or more transitive
      objects, for example, 'enjoys' in Amadeus

      This contrasts with intransitive verbs,
      which do not entail transitive objects,
      for example, 'arose' in Beatrice arose.
