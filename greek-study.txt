|  interrogative
|      /ˌɪntəˈrɒɡətɪv/
|      adjective
|      having the force of a question.
|      "a hard, interrogative stare"
| 
|  transitive verb
|      A verb that entails one or more transitive
|      objects, for example, 'enjoys' in Amadeus

|       which do not entail transitive objects,
|       for example, 'arose' in Beatrice arose.
