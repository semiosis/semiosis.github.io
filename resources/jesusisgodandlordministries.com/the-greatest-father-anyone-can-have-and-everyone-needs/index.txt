The Greatest Father Anyone Can Have And Everyone Needs

As we celebrate Father's Day today, I want to tell you about the
greatest Father of all.

This sermon is about the greatest Father anyone can have and everyone
needs, but only a few people have the privilege to be able to call him
Father. God the Father is Father to all who are true born again Christians
washed in the blood of Jesus. He sets the example for all earthly dads to
follow. God the Father will always be there for you even when your natural
dad forsakes you. (Psalm 27:10 When my father and my mother forsake me,
then the LORD will take me up.)  

God the Father never fails in his love for his children. He showed
his ultimate love for his children as well as for those he desires to be
his children by sending his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ to die for our
sins so that we may have eternal life and restore the intended
relationship with him and man that was broken by the sin of Adam. (John
3:16 ¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life.) (II Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some
men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any
should perish, but that all should come to repentance.) Those who receive
Jesus as their Saviour are adopted by God the Father as his children.
(John 1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:) (Romans 8:14-15
14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye
have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.) As
children of God we can call him Abba, Father or Daddy. As a good Father he
chasteneth his children. He does this out of love and not to hurt us just
as an earthly dad disciplines his children so they will stay on the
straight and narrow. (Hebrews 12:6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.) Another way God the Father
shows us love is that he allows Jesus to be our intercessor before him
when Satan comes before his throne to accuse us of some sin. Jesus tells
the Father that our sin has been washed in his blood. We see that God the
Father is forgiving. (Ephesians 4:32 And be ye kind one to another,
tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath
forgiven you.) Earthly dads need to follow the example of our heavenly
Father in forgiving their children when they do wrong.

God the Father is pleased in his Son and his adopted children. This
is seen at the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist. (Matthew 3:13-17 13 ¶
Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and
comest thou to me? 15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be
so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
suffered him. 16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out
of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the
Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 17 And lo a
voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased.) (Mark 1:9-11 9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus
came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 10 And
straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the
Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 11 And there came a voice from
heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.) (Luke
3:21-22 21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 22 And the
Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice
came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well
pleased.) We see this again when Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a
high mountain and was transfigured before them displaying the true glory
of his Son Jesus. (Matthew 17:1-9 1 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter,
James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain
apart, 2 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the
sun, and his raiment was white as the light. 3 And, behold, there appeared
unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. 4 Then answered Peter, and
said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us
make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
Elias. 5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and
behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. 6 And when the disciples heard it,
they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. 7 And Jesus came and
touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. 8 And when they had
lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. 9 And as they came
down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no
man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.) (Mark 9:2-9 2 ¶
And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and
leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was
transfigured before them. 3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding
white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them. 4 And there
appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. 5
And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be
here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses,
and one for Elias. 6 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore
afraid. 7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came
out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 8 And
suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save
Jesus only with themselves. 9 And as they came down from the mountain, he
charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till
the Son of man were risen from the dead.) (II Peter 1:17-18 17 For he
received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a
voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased. 18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when
we were with him in the holy mount.) We see a third time that God the
Father speaks audibly to Jesus in answer to his prayer. We not only see
that God the Father hears and answers our prayers, but also cares about
what we ask for. Jesus prayed and asked that God the Father's name be
glorified and it was. This was shortly before he went to the cross for our
sins. (John 12:28-30 28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice
from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it
thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. 30 Jesus answered and said,
This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.)

God the Father's house has many mansions prepared by Jesus for all
those who have received his Son Jesus. (John 14:2 In my Father's house are
many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a
place for you.) Our Heavenly Father sent the Comforter, who is the Holy
Ghost to indwell in believers after Pentecost. He cares enough for his
adopted children that he does not want us to be alone. Jesus acknowledges
the Father is righteous in John 17:25. (John 17:25 O righteous Father, the
world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known
that thou hast sent me.)

God the Father raised Jesus from the dead by the Holy Ghost. Without
Jesus's resurrection, we would still be dead in our sins. (Galatians 1:1
Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and
God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) (I Corinthians 15:17 And if
Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.) God
the Father along with Jesus gives us grace, mercy, and peace. (II Timothy
1:2 To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God
the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.) (Titus 1:4 To Titus, mine own son
after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.)

God the Father will take control of the kingdom from Jesus following
the end of the millennium after Jesus has conquered death. God the Father
will run the kingdom during eternity. (I Corinthians 15:24-28 24
Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God,
even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority
and power.
25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things
are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all
things under him.
28 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also
himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be
all in all.)

Our Heavenly Father is omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all
knowing), and omnipresent (present everywhere at once). (Revelation 19:6
And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of
many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for
the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.) We see he has foreknowledge in I Peter
1:2. (I Peter 1:2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the
blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.) We also
see in this verse how God already knows who will receive his Son and be
saved. This does not mean that only those people can be saved only that
they chose to be saved. All may who seek Jesus be saved. Our heavenly
Father rides around in a chariot of clouds (Psalm 104:3 Who layeth the
beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot:
who walketh upon the wings of the wind:). God the Father has always
existed and allowed his Son Jesus to create everything for his glory. He
is the Ancient of Days (Daniel 7:9 ¶ I beheld till the thrones were cast
down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow,
and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery
flame, and his wheels as burning fire.) He also allows his adoptive
children to also serve him by telling others about Jesus and in many ways
in the church.

The Father never changes and will always do his will and pleasure.
(Isaiah 46:9-10 9 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and
there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, 10 Declaring the
end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet
done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:)

When we pray, we are to pray to the Father in the name of Jesus. The
Father gives us our needs and answers our prayers if it is his will if we
ask the Father in Jesus's name. This is Jesus's name, not Mary's name or
any other false god such as Allah. God the Father always provides for his
children according to his will. (John 16:23 And in that day ye shall ask
me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the
Father in my name, he will give it you.) The Father provides his children
with perfect gifts, not junk or unwanted things. (James 1:17 Every good
gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father
of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.) Jesus
said in Matthew 7:11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts
unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven
give good things to them that ask him?

God will also sometimes take his children home early who are being
disobedient. If a believer continues in their sin without confession, God
may bring them home early. They will not lose their salvation, just their
earthly life. He does this for his sake and ours. (I John 5:16 If any man
see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he
shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto
death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.)

God the Father cares so much for us and hates sin so much that when
his only begotten Son Jesus was on the cross bearing the sins for the
whole world for all time, he could not even look at his Son. (Mark 15:34
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi,
lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast
thou forsaken me?) (Matthew 27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?)

God the Father is the Father of all believers. He is the first person
in the Godhead. We are made in his image. He should be the heavenly
example to all earthly dads. God the Father is love which all earthly dads
should follow. All dads should raise their children in a godly manner and
home. Dads should make time with their family to study scripture together.
It is his responsibility to be the spiritual leader in the house and to
teach his children about Jesus. He needs to set the example for the family
by being a man of God, being a great husband for his wife, loving and
cherishing her, and being a great dad for his children, loving them and
spending time with them. Let them know that God is to be first in their
lives above everything and everyone else including their dad. Make sure
the family is brought each service to a God fearing Biblically based
church. Do your best to see that all of your family is won for the Lord,
so they too will have a heavenly Father.

God the Father is love and this is best seen through his Son. The
best way to know God the Father is through his Son Jesus Christ. Jesus
said in John 10:30 I and my Father are one. (John 3:35 The Father loveth
the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.) (I John 4:8-11 8 He
that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. 9 In this was manifested
the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son
into the world, that we might live through him. 10 Herein is love, not
that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also
to love one another.) Dads be an example to love the way God does.
(Proverbs 22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is
old, he will not depart from it.) (Isaiah 54:13 And all thy children shall
be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.)
(Ephesians 6:4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but
bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.) (Proverbs 17:6
Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children
are their fathers.) Proverbs 17:6 especially applies to children with a
godly dad.  

To be able to call God your Father, ye must be born again. I pray
that all will want him for their Father. Obey the gospel and receive Jesus
as your Saviour.
