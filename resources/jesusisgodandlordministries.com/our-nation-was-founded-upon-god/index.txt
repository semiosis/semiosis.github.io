Our Nation Was Founded Upon God

Today is Independence Day, the day we celebrate our nation's 245^th
birthday and our independence from Great Britain. The United States of
America was founded on July 4, 1776. It was on this date and year that our
nation began, not in 1619 as is being falsely claimed today by haters of
the USA. This nation was founded upon God despite what the liberals are
trying to teach by changing and erasing history. The United States of
America was founded by godly men and was based upon godly principles. God
blessed this nation from her start due to the reverence given to God, yet
today this nation has abandoned God and therefore God has abandoned
America. This nation was great because it had God in the picture and a
fear of God. Today that fear of God is gone as most Americans have not
only rejected Jesus, but God in general. This nation needs to turn back to
God in order to become great again.

Most of our nation's founding fathers were men of God and men who
feared God. Not all of them were true Christians, but even those who were
not Christians still acknowledged God and respected those who were
Christians. Today if you are a Christian leader in our government, you can
guarantee you will be mocked and attacked. Our founding fathers based our
Constitution on Biblical principles. Before the Constitution was approved
by the states, ten amendments were added. The first was the most important
as it gave people freedom to worship God without interference from the
government and prevented a state religion in order to prevent the Church
of England or the Roman Catholic Church from controlling our government as
in Europe and to keep taxpayers from having to pay taxes to a church they
did not belong to. Liberals have tried to infringe upon these rights
during the COVID-19 pandemic by preventing worship of God. The first
amendment says "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ..." This right must
never be allowed to be taken away from us.

Of the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4,
1776, 24 had seminary or Bible college degrees. John Witherspoon was a
Presbyterian minister and president of College of New Jersey (today known
as Princeton University) which was originally a Presbyterian Bible school.
This shows the importance of God to most of our nation's founding fathers.
The following are some quotes from some of our founding fathers. Many
today try to deny that our nation was founded upon God and by godly men,
but these quotes will show the truth. George Washington who was our
nation's first president said "While we are zealously performing the
duties of good citizens and soldiers, we certainly ought not to be
inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the distinguished
character of Patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more
distinguished character of Christian." George Washington was a man who
prayed for his soldiers at Valley Forge during the harsh winter of
1777-1778. He often mentioned God in his speeches. Benjamin Franklin who
signed the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution said
"Here is my Creed. I believe in one God, the Creator of the Universe. That
He governs it by His Providence. That He ought to be worshipped." Samuel
Adams who signed the Declaration of Independence and was a leader of the
Revolutionary War while governor of Massachusetts in 1797 said "And as it
is our duty to extend our wishes to the happiness of the great family of
man, I conceive that we cannot better express ourselves than by humbly
supplicating the Supreme Ruler of the world that the rod of tyrants may be
broken to pieces, and the oppressed made free again; that wars may cease
in all the earth, and that the confusions that are and have been among
nations may be overruled by promoting and speedily bringing on that holy
and happy period when the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ may
be everywhere established, and all people everywhere willingly bow to the
sceptre of Him who is Prince of Peace." James Madison the 4^th president
said "A watchful eye must be kept on ourselves lest while we are building
ideal monuments of Renown and Bliss here we neglect to have our names
enrolled in the Annals of Heaven." John Quincy Adams, the 6^th president
of the United States said "The hope of a Christian is inseparable from his
faith. Whoever believes in the divine inspiration of the Holy Scriptures
must hope that the religion of Jesus shall prevail throughout the earth.
Never since the foundation of the world have the prospects of mankind been
more encouraging to that hope than they appear to be at the present time.
And may the associated distribution of the Bible proceed and prosper till
the Lord shall have made 'bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the
nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God'
(Isaiah 52:10)." William Penn who founded Pennsylvania said "I do declare
to the whole world that we believe the Scriptures to contain a declaration
of the mind and will of God in and to those ages in which they were
written; being given forth by the Holy Ghost moving in the hearts of holy
men of God; that they ought also to be read, believed, and fulfilled in
our day; being used for reproof and instruction, that the man of God may
be perfect. They are a declaration and testimony of heavenly things
themselves, and, as such, we carry a high respect for them. We accept them
as the words of God Himself." Roger Sherman who signed the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution said "I believe that there is one only
living and true God, existing in three persons, the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost ..." "I believe that God having elected some of mankind
to eternal life, did send his own Son to become man, die in the room and
stead of sinners and thus to lay a foundation for the offer of pardon and
salvation to all mankind, so as all may be saved who are willing to accept
the gospel offer: also by his special grace and spirit, to regenerate,
sanctify and enable to persevere in holiness, all who shall be saved; ..."
Patrick Henry who was a ratifier of the U.S. Constitution and best known
for saying "Give me liberty, or give me death!", said "It cannot be
emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded,
not by religionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but on the
gospel of Jesus Christ. For this very reason peoples of other faiths have
been afforded asylum, prosperity, and freedom of worship here." and "The
Bible ... is a book worth more than all the other books that were ever
printed."  John Jay was the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and
president of the American Bible Society who said "In forming and settling
my belief relative to the doctrines of Christianity, I adopted no articles
from creeds but such only as, on careful examination, I found to be
confirmed by the Bible." and "The Bible will also inform them that our
gracious Creator has provided for us a Redeemer, in whom all the nations
of the earth shall be blessed; that this Redeemer has made atonement 'for
the sins of the whole world,' and thereby reconciling the Divine justice
with the Divine mercy has opened a way for our redemption and salvation;
and that these inestimable benefits are of the free gift and grace of God,
not of our deserving, nor in our power to deserve." Benjamin Rush who
signed the Declaration of Independence and was a ratifier of the
Constitution said "The gospel of Jesus Christ prescribes the wisest rules
for just conduct in every situation of life. Happy they who are enabled to
obey them in all situations!" John Hancock who was the first to sign the
Declaration of Independence said "... Continue steadfast and, with a proper
sense of your dependence on God, nobly defend those rights which heaven
gave, and no man ought to take from us." John Adams was a signer of the
Declaration of independence as well as the 2^nd U.S. president and the dad
of John Quincy Adams. He raised his family in a godly home and had family
devotions around the Holy Bible. Many of these men had many other quotes
about God and Jesus as did many other prominent men who founded our nation
with the help of God. Those who signed the Declaration of Independence
were knowingly putting their lives on the line, yet these men were willing
to die for our freedom as a nation to be able to worship God and Jesus and
to preach the gospel. These men all understood that this nation must be
founded upon God and Jesus if it was to survive and be blessed. This
principle held this nation together for a long time, but today is under
severe attack as Satan has a stranglehold on our nation. This is why we
see our nation falling apart and divided and crime rising as Jesus has
been removed from our nation in nearly every aspect even including most
churches and by many who profess to be Christians. Many professing
Christians only add Jesus to their lives when they have time for him or it
is convenient for them, but do not submit to him as the Lord of their
lives. This has led to the destruction of the church in all denominations
including Baptists.

Most of our nations early colleges were all founded as seminaries.
106 out of the first 108 colleges founded in America were founded by
Christians. Some are Yale, Harvard, and Princeton. Yale was started by
clergymen. Harvard was named after a Christian minister. The first teacher
at Princeton was the minister Jonathan Dickinson. Princeton's crest still
says "Dei sub numine viget," which is Latin for "Under God she
flourishes." Today these universities are extremely liberal and hardly any
sign of God is found anywhere if at all. How sad.

Children in our schools in the early days learned how to read by
reading a King James Bible. This shows that it is not a hard Bible to read
as is often falsely claimed by those who hate and attack the King James
Bible. President George Washington started the custom of placing your hand
on a Holy Bible and swearing on the Holy Bible when you were sworn into
public office. This was to show that you were given your position in
office by God as well as to show that if you do wrong before the people,
you have also done wrong or sinned against God as you have taken an oath
on God's holy word. You have lied before God. Today politicians make a
mockery of their oaths before God and some have even been sworn into
office on a Koran (Quran).

I have already mentioned how the first amendment of the U.S.
Constitution prohibits a state religion. Just because a state religion is
prohibited does not mean that God is not allowed in our government. People
today are trying to remove all mention of God from our government, yet
this was never the intention of our founding fathers. As I said it was
only to prevent a state religion, but not to remove God from government.
In fact the U.S. Capitol was used to hold church services every Sunday
morning in what is today known as Statuary Hall. This was where the House
of Representatives met. Various denominations held services here with up
to four church services every Sunday. Church services were held here from
1807-1857. Church services have also been held in executive branch
buildings and in the Supreme Court yet today they have prohibited God in
school for the most part as in most of the rest of our government and
including the military by saying God has no part of government. Our
constitution allows God in our government and schools. It just cannot be
mandatory.

Many of our government buildings used to acknowledge God. The Supreme
Court displays the ten commandments as did formerly other courts. The
Liberty Bell in Philadelphia quotes part of Leviticus 25:10 from the King
James Bible and says "Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all
the Inhabitants Thereof Lev. XXV. v X." The bell's designers knew where
our liberty as Americans truly came from. It has been said that only two
people have died for our freedom; Jesus and the American soldier. This is
true. In the prayer room of the U.S. Capitol is the quote "Annuit coeptis"
(God has favored our undertakings) and also Psalm 16:1 from the King James
Bible "Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust." In the Senate
chamber over the east doorway is the quote "Annuit coeptis" (God has
favored our undertakings) and over the south entrance is the phrase "In
God we trust". "In God we trust" is also found in the House chamber. If
only the people in those chambers actually believed that.  

Our independence as a nation was allowed by God to happen because of
the godly men who founded it. God intended our nation to be a lighthouse
to the world just as Israel was and is his chosen nation. God had a
special blessing on this nation from the start and we have been more
blessed by God than any nation in the history of the world with the sole
exception possibly of Israel. Our nation has been the leader of the free
world for a long time and has produced many brilliant inventors,
scientists, preachers, and other great people who have been the envy of
the world. Initially our nation obeyed God and thanked God for his
blessings on the nation by sending more missionaries to the world to
spread the gospel and reach people for Jesus. Today as our nation has
fallen away from Jesus; it is our nation that has missionaries sent to it.
Our own nation is ripe for harvest as it is filled with many unsaved
people. Many today no longer identify as Christians. How sad considering
this is what our nation was founded on.

God gives freedom to people. Many brave men have died for our nation
in our wars, but true freedom only comes from God and his son Jesus,
especially for those who are saved and have received Jesus as their
Saviour. Only those who are saved will have true freedom from spiritual
death and independence from Satan. Jesus will save all of those who call
upon him by admitting they are a sinner in need of a Saviour. All of us
have sinned and sin leads to death. (Romans 3:23 For all have sinned, and
come short of the glory of God;) (Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is
death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.)
(Romans 6:6-9 6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that
the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve
sin.
7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.
8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with
him:
9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath
no more dominion over him.) Receiving Jesus as your Saviour will free you
from spiritual death. When we see the American flag, let us always
remember that it represents the freedom we have as Americans given to us
by God our Creator. Do not burn it or disrespect it as is done by people
who hate God and hate this nation which was founded upon God. These people
hate freedom just as Satan does. Thomas Jefferson was the drafter and
signer of the Declaration of Independence and the 3^rd president of the
United States of America. Thomas Jefferson was not a true Christian in
that he denied Jesus was God, but he acknowledged God in general. He
admitted that our freedom came from God. He said "God who gave us life
gave us liberty. And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when
we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the
people that these liberties are of the Gift of God? That they are not to
be violated but with His wrath? Indeed, I tremble for my country when I
reflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever..." While
the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor represents freedom for Americans,
the cross of Jesus Christ at Calvary represents freedom for Christians.
Here are some verses that show our freedom and liberty comes from God and
God alone. (II Corinthians 3:17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.) (Galatians 5:1 Stand fast
therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not
entangled again with the yoke of bondage.) (Romans 8:21 Because the
creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption
into the glorious liberty of the children of God.) We are no longer bound
to the law because of the death of Jesus for us. (Romans 7:6 But now we
are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we
should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.)
God gave freedom to this nation 245 years ago today because godly men
honored and followed the Lord. This nation needs to repent of her many
sins and turn back to God if she wants to survive for many more years
until the return of Jesus. Individuals must call upon Jesus to save them.
Let us pray for godly leaders to return to our government. God said if a
nation will turn back to him he will heal it. This verse is referring to
Christians, so it must start with us. (II Chronicles 7:14 If my people,
which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek
my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven,
and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.) (Proverbs 14:34
Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.) As
we celebrate Independence Day today while we grill and eat hot dogs and
hamburgers and watch fireworks, let us remember the godly men who risked
all for our freedom as our founding fathers, let us remember those who
gave their lives in wars for our freedom, and most of all let us remember
that our freedom comes from God and let us thank him for it and pray that
we may continue to have the freedom he gave us to be able to worship him
freely. Let us set time apart today to pray for our nation and our leaders
and that all Americans will turn back to God and for those who are lost
that today they will call upon Jesus to be saved. Let all heads of the
household say as Joshua did "as for me and my house, we will serve the
LORD." [Joshua 24:15] If America will turn back to God, she can be saved
and be blessed once more. May God bless America and may America bless God.
(Psalm 33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people
whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.)
