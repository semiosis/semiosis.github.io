Honour Thy Mother

Happy Mother's Day to all of the moms. (Exodus 20:12 ¶ Honour thy
father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the
LORD thy God giveth thee.) God commands us in the fifth commandment to
honour our father and mother. God will give longer life for those who obey
him. This is the only commandment that gives this promise. This
commandment separates the ten commanments into two parts. The first four
commandments have to do with man's relationship with God and the last six
starting with this one have to do with man's relationship to man. God
realizes that for man to get along with each other, it must start in the
home which is why I believe this is why this commandment is first among
those related to man. The relationship to one's parents often tends to
affect how people think about God. God commands us to honour our mother
always and not just on Mother's Day. Moms are special. They gave birth to
us and have tended to us when we were hurt. Moms have cooked our meals and
washed our clothes and gave us love when no one else did except God. The
best mom is always your own mom even if the person does not realize it.
She is the one God gave to you.

Julia Ward Howe had pushed for Mother's Day in 1870. Mother's Day was
first celebrated in the United States of America in modern times in 1907
in Grafton, West Virginia at St. Andrews Methodist Church by Anna Jarvis.
She pushed to make this a national holiday. By 1911 all U.S. states
celebrated Mother's Day and in 1914 it was made a national holiday on the
second Sunday in May. The day soon became commercialized and Anna Jarvis
opposed this by saying the day was intended to honour one's mom with
personal letters and other ways of love and was not to be exploited
commercially. People should celebrate Mother's Day to honour the Lord and
his commandment and not just because it is a holiday that is on the
calendar and we are expected to observe it because it is on the calendar.
Mother's Day is also celebrated in other nations. This day helps us to
remember and obey the fifth commandment. This day is set aside for moms
who are females from birth, not trasgendered males who think they are moms
or the female version of homosexual males who have adopted a child and
think they are moms.

Scripture has much to say about mothers, especially for those who
dishonour her. Proverbs 29:15 says a child not disciplined brings his mom
shame. (Proverbs 29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left
to himself bringeth his mother to shame.) Proverbs 1:8 says not to forsake
the law of your mother. (Proverbs 1:8 My son, hear the instruction of thy
father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:) A foolish son is the
heaviness of his mom. (Proverbs 10:1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son
maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.)
God makes moms to be joyful of her children. (Psalm 113:9 He maketh the
barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise
ye the LORD.) God says a foolish man despises his mom. (Proverbs 15:20 A
wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.)
God will take the life of those who curse their mom. Even if your mom was
not always there for you or showed you little love, she is still your mom
and God commands us to honour them. (Proverbs 20:20 Whoso curseth his
father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.) A
son that chaseth away his mom brings her shame. (Proverbs 19:26 He that
wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth
shame, and bringeth reproach.) God says a generation will come that does
not honour their mother. This is seen much today as people disobey God in
all ways, including their moms. (Proverbs 30:11 There is a generation that
curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.) We are to honour
our moms even when they get old. (Proverbs 23:22 Hearken unto thy father
that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.) Micah 7:6
tells us what happens when there is no honour of parents in a house.
(Micah 7:6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up
against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's
enemies are the men of his own house.) Scripture says to honour older
women as you would your mom. (I Timothy 5:1-2 1 Rebuke not an elder, but
intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;
2 The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.)
Jesus himself spoke of the fifth commandment when he rebuked the Pharisees
who try to find a loophole in not honouring their parents by saying people
who give money to the treasury, do not have to take care of their parents
since the money is for God. This was a manmade tradition that Jesus
condemned. (Matthew 15:4-6 4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father
and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a
gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
6 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye
made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.) Jesus again
repeated the commandment to honour your mother. (Mark 10:19 Thou knowest
the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do
not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.) Jesus
followed through with this commandment himself when he made sure his mom
Mary would be taken care of by John after his death on the cross. (John
19:25-27 25 ¶ Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom
he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour
that disciple took her unto his own home.) Paul reminds us to obey this
commandment and get extended life by God. (Ephesians 6:1-3 1 Children,
obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with
promise;)
3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.)
Proverbs speaks of a virtuous woman and some of her attributes. (Proverbs
31:25-28 25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in
time to come.
26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of
kindness.
27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread
of idleness.
28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he
praiseth her.) All moms should strive to be like this woman. Isaiah 66:13
says God will comfort like a mother. (Isaiah 66:13 As one whom his mother
comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in
Jerusalem.)

Scripture mentions some mothers who had a bad influence on their
children. One such mother was Jezebel. This wicked woman not only
influenced her husband king Ahab, but also her children especially her son
Joram who became king. Jezebel herself was into witchcraft and influenced
her children. (II Kings 9:22 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu,
that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as
the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?)
Another wicked mom was Athaliah. When Athaliah saw that her son, the king
was dead, she tried to kill off all of her children and any other royal
seed so that she could be queen. (II Kings 11:1-3 1 And when Athaliah the
mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all
the seed royal.
2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash
the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's
sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the
bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
3 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah
did reign over the land.) How wicked a mom that could kill her own
children. Let these women be a warning to moms everywhere to be godly as
all moms will influence their children either good or evil. Just like
these wicked moms, some moms today forsake their children, but God the
Father will never forsake you. (Isaiah 49:15 Can a woman forget her
sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?
yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.)

The first mom was Eve who is the mother of all living as all people
who have ever lived have descended from her and Adam. (Genesis 3:20 And
Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all
living.) Eve was the first mom who had to deal with the heartache of
losing a child, after her son Abel was murdered by her other son Cain. She
then lost Cain as well when God sent him away. (Genesis 4:14 Behold, thou
hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face
shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and
it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.)

Scripture mentions many godly women that all moms today can emulate.
Timothy's mother Eunice taught him faith which she was taught by her godly
mom Lois. If only all moms would be like these two ladies and teach their
children about Jesus. May this be a goal for all moms. (II Timothy 1:5
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which
dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am
persuaded that in thee also.) Mary the mother of Jesus, the man, was
willing to believe the Holy Ghost would conceive a child in her without a
man being involved. Mary encouraged people to obey whatever Jesus told
them to do. (John 2:5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he
saith unto you, do it.) [This was at the wedding in Cana when Jesus turned
water into wine.] Mary by faith trusted the angel who told her that her
Son would be the Messiah and she endured the mocking of her Son Jesus, but
never doubted Jesus at any time despite all of this. Mary was called
blessed since she had the honour of giving birth to the Messiah in Jesus
Christ. (Luke 1:28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou
that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among
women.) Women in biblical days were considered blessed if they had
children and the more the better. A woman was considered cursed if she
could not have children. This shows how it was considered by women an
honour to be a mom. All Jewish women were wanting to be the one who gave
birth to the Messiah. Mary was the one chosen by God for this honour.
Sarah had faith that she could have a child at an old age. She conceived
Isaac at age 90. (Hebrews 11:11 Through faith also Sara herself received
strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past
age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.) Elizabeth the
mother of John the Baptist also through faith conceived in her old age.
(Luke 1:36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a
son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called
barren.) Hannah was a great mom who was barren for a long time, but she
never gave up on God, but kept praying for a son and told God that if he
would give her a son, she would dedicate him and give him to the LORD. God
honoured the request of Hannah with the birth of Samuel who was given to
the LORD just as she had promised. Samuel became the last judge of Israel
and Israel's first prophet and was a great man of God. Hannah was blessed
by God for her willingness to give up Samuel that she was blessed with
three more sons and two daughters after Samuel. This is told in I Samuel
2:21. (I Samuel 2:21 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived,
and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before
the LORD.) Rebekah trusted God in her barrenness and was blessed with
twins Jacob and Esau. Rebekah was a hard worker and was very hospitable to
strangers. Rebekah was willing to leave her dad and family in order by
faith to marry Isaac whom she had never met and go into a new land.
Rebekah also was willing to be cursed in order to protect her son Jacob.
(Genesis 27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:
only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.) Deborah was a mother that was
not afraid to stand up for what was right and for God. She was a judge and
prophetess of Israel and a military leader who helped deliver Israel from
her enemies as well as a mother. Ruth is another great mom of scripture.
Ruth was a Moabitess and daughter in law of Naomi. After her husband died,
she followed Naomi back to Israel and worshipped her God Jehovah, the true
God and stopped worshipping her false gods of Moab and gave up her people.
(Ruth 1:16 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou
lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my
God:)Ruth trusted her mother in law and worked hard to support her. She
married Boaz and would become the great grandmother of king David and a
part of the genealogy of Jesus. Jochebed was the mother of Moses. By faith
she and her husband hid Moses from pharaoh who ordered Hebrew male
children to death. She refused to allow her child to be put to death even
if it meant disobedience. (Hebrews 11:23 By faith Moses, when he was born,
was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper
child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.) Moses would go
on to lead Israel out of Egypt and would receive the ten commandments from
God. Rachel the mother of Joseph and Benjamin was willing to support her
husband Jacob even after she was denied being allowed to marry him after
Jacob was deceived into marrying Leah when Rachel had been promised to
him. Rachel was a hard worker who took care of the sheep. Samson's mom's
name is not mentioned in scripture, but she wanted a son and had been
praying. The angel of the LORD appeared to her and she was willing to
trust him and his word and she told her husband Manoah to come and hear
him. Samson went on to be a Nazarite and judge Israel. There are other
godly women in scripture as well.

May all moms strive to be godly and raise their children in a godly
home. A mother never knows what her child may become so she always needs
to raise him right. Some moms will be blessed enough to have children like
some of these moms. Moms need to set the example along with dads by
reading and studying scripture and keeping their children away from evil.
May no mothers be like the wicked moms mentioned earlier. May all people
strive to remember their moms not only on this Mother's Day, but always
and to always honour them as God has commanded us. God bless moms.
