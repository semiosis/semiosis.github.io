Jude

Jude is one of the shortest books in the new testament and in
scripture with only twenty five verses. Jude is the twenty sixth book in
the new testament and sixty fifth book in the Holy Bible. The writer Jude
is a brother of Jesus and was not a believer until after the resurrection
of Jesus. He was also the brother of James who wrote James. The purpose of
this short book was to address the heresy of Gnosticism that was making
headways in the church.  Jude does not seem to be writing to any specific
local church, but rather the church as a whole. Gnosticism said that God
did not come in the flesh and that knowledge was more important than faith
and that only certain people were given this secret knowledge. One early
Christian is reported to have said that John wrote the gospel of John to
show the falsehood of Gnosticism and that Jesus was God in the flesh and
the Son of God. This may or may not be true.

(Jude 1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ,
and called:) This verse clearly shows that Jude is the brother of James
and of Jesus, but Jude does not call Jesus his brother, but rather he says
he is a servant of Jesus Christ. This shows how Jude was now a believer
and understood that Jesus was the Jewish Messiah (Christ). He writes this
short book to those who are sanctified by God the Father and preserved in
Jesus Christ and who have been called by Jesus. He was referring to true
Christians who were preserved in their faith of Jesus Christ and had not
been corrupted by the teachings of Gnosticism. This preservation by Jesus
is confirmation of how if a person is saved then they cannot lose their
salvation. [Once saved, always saved.] Only Jesus as God can preserve our
salvation, not us.   

(Jude 2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.) Jude
wishes that mercy, peace, and love be multiplied on the Christians he is
writing to.

(Jude 3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you
that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered
unto the saints.) Jude says it was necessary to write to the people so
that they would once again contend (stand for) for the faith that was
first preached to them rather than being persuaded by Gnosticism and other
false doctrines. Jude was saying that the original gospel they had heard
had not changed. The first part shows that Jude had originally wanted to
write about the common salvation, but the Holy Ghost would not allow him
to as there was an urgent matter that he needed to write about instead and
that was to stand up for the faith that was originally taught to them and
to fight against Gnosticism and other false beliefs. This shows scripture
is inspired and the writers only wrote what the Holy Ghost directed them
to.

(Jude 4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before
of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of
our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord
Jesus Christ.) Jude shows in this verse how certain men had crept in
unawares to deceive the people with this false Gnosticism and to turn them
away from God and the truth. These were false teachers who pretended to be
Christians and had deceived the people in the church. Jude says these were
ungodly men. These men had denied the Lord Jesus Christ who is the only
Lord, not Satan or anyone else. By denying Jesus they also had denied God
the Father. These men had turned the grace of God into lasciviousness
(sexual lust). 

(Jude 5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew
this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt,
afterward destroyed them that believed not.) Jude says that he wants to
remind those false Christians in the church that God will destroy them
just as he did with those Israelites who did not believe even after God
had saved the people out of Egypt. Jude says the people once knew this
truth, but they had now become so fallen away that they no longer knew it.
Hebrews shows how God did not let the Israelites enter the Promised Land
because of their unbelief. (Hebrews 3:19 So we see that they could not
enter in because of unbelief.)

(Jude 6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under
darkness unto the judgment of the great day.) Jude speaks of the angels of
Genesis 6 who left their first estate of heaven where they were supposed
to live when God made them and they came down to earth to mate with women.
This sin produced the giants. (Genesis 6:2 That the sons of God saw the
daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all
which they chose.) (Genesis 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those
days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters
of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which
were of old, men of renown.) For this sin, God has placed them in
everlasting chains in the bottomless pit in darkness until the day they
our judged before God. It is at this time that they will be cast into the
lake of fire for all eternity. (II Peter 2:4 For if God spared not the
angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into
chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;) Other angels that fell
with Satan are not locked up at this time including Satan. These angels
are locked up because they tried to corrupt all of mankind's DNA and
prevent Jesus from being born as a man without sin so that Satan and the
rebellious angels would not be cast into hell which was made for them.
(Matthew 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels:)

(Jude 7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange
flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal
fire.) Here God connects the sin of the angels in verse 6 with the sin of
Sodom and Gomorrha and the three cities around them. This shows that the
sin committed by the angels in verse 6 was sexual. Just as the people of
Sodom and Gomorrha were guilty of homosexuality as seen by the phrase
"going after strange flesh", these angels also went after strange flesh by
mating with women which God never intended. God also never intended for
people to be homosexuals and this is why God destroyed these cities. The
people of Sodom and Gomorrha and the other cities that were destroyed all
will spend eternity in the lake of fire just as the angels of verse 6
will. Those who commit homosexuality and never repent will also spend
eternity in the lake of fire.

(Jude 8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
dominion, and speak evil of dignities.) These false teachers in the church
"filthy dreamers" also defile the flesh by teaching false doctrines that
will send people to hell. These people despise authority and speak evil of
those over them. This includes not only governmental people, but also
church leaders such as the pastors and deacons. They also reject the
authority of the Lord Jesus Christ as head of the church as they deny him.
Just as the Israelites had rejected the authority of Moses and God, these
people do the same bringing much harm not only to themselves, but also to
those who they brainwash with their false teachings.

(Jude 9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing
accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.) This verse shows Michael is
an archangel, the only one given that description in scripture. Elsewhere
Michael is one of the chief princes. (Daniel 10:13 But the prince of the
kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one
of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings
of Persia.) The devil wanted the body of Moses and Michael got in a
dispute with him over it, but never accused Satan as Satan was a more
powerful angel and in authority and so instead he just said the Lord
rebuke thee. Michael understood that it is only God who has authority to
bring accusation against Satan.

(Jude 10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not:
but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they
corrupt themselves.) This verse shows how the evil doers in the church had
no problem speaking evil of those things they know not of, but as natural
sinners continue in their sin. People often speak evil of things they know
nothing about. Jude compares them to animals (brute beasts). We saw how in
verse 9 Michael even as an archangel and one of the chief princes did not
accuse Satan, yet these ungodly men had no problem doing so against
people.

(Jude 11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and
ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the
gainsaying of Core.) Jude says they have gone in the way of Cain. We know
Cain was the first murderer in scripture when he killed his brother Abel
and the first to refuse to repent and later go to hell. Cain refused to
turn back to God even when God gave him many chances. Cain rejected the
way of the cross and wanted works for his salvation. The error of Balaam
is their reward. Balaam was the Midianite hired by the Moabite king to
curse Israel. God used a talking ass to get Balaam's attention who then
was used by God to instead bless Israel rather than curse Israel. Balaam
would later influence the Israelites (intermarriage to Moabites) to commit
many sins and to follow false gods. (Numbers 25:1-3 And Israel abode in
Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of
Moab.
2 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the
people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
3 And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was
kindled against Israel.) (Numbers 31:16 Behold, these caused the children
of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the
LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation
of the LORD.) (Revelation 2:14 But I have a few things against thee,
because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught
Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat
things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.) God had the
Israelites kill him. (Numbers 31:8 And they slew the kings of Midian,
beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur,
and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they
slew with the sword.)  Balaam knew the truth about God, yet he still
rejected it and this applies to all three men. Core is a reference to
Korah who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron and God had the earth
swallow him up. Korah was rejecting the men chosen by God and therefore
rejecting God. (Numbers 16:32 And the earth opened her mouth, and
swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto
Korah, and all their goods.) God took the lives of all of these men and
all three are now in hell. God said woe unto these ungodly men causing the
false lies in the church, for their destruction will be similar to these
three men.  

(Jude 12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast
with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water,
carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice
dead, plucked up by the roots;) Jude says these ungodly men who have
entered the church pretended to be godly in order to deceive the people.
They ate with the people without fear and pretended to be righteous by
giving to the poor. Some say they took communion with the church without
fear when God said he has taken the lives of those who take it unworthily.
This may or may not be referenced here. I believe it just refers to actual
feasts or meals that the church had in order to have fellowship just as is
often done today. Baptists are notorious in their eating and usually there
is always fried chicken. Jude describes these men as fakes similar to a
cloud without water. Clouds carry water to water the earth and with no
water they are useless. This applies to professing Christians who bear no
fruit which is a sign of a false Christian. They are of no use any more
than the unsaved. We see this in the reference to the fruit all dried up
and the trees without fruit. Scripture says you can know a true Christian
by their fruit. (Matthew 7:20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
them.) As ungodly men they could not bring forth any good fruit. (Matthew
7:18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit.) These men are carried by the wind just as many
are carried by false doctrines. Jude says these ungodly men are carried
about just as clouds are by the wind. They follow every new doctrine that
comes about. (Ephesians 4:14 That we henceforth be no more children,
tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the
sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
deceive;) We as Christians are to make sure what is being taught is
scriptural. Jude says these ungodly men are twice dead showing they are
not true Christians who are born again. True Christians are born twice and
die once whereas the unsaved are born once and die twice. This second
death sends you to the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:14 And death and hell
were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.)

(Jude 13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;
wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.)
Jude continues his description of these ungodly men by saying they are
like raging waves from a storm that bring about foam. This is the false
doctrines they spue out of their mouth. Jude says they are like wandering
stars. Stars are used for navigation and a wandering star is useless for
this purpose and so is a false preacher like they are to find the true
gospel. They have no purpose. They have the darkness of hell as their
eternal destiny.

(Jude 14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,) Enoch
prophesied of these false teachers entering the church in the last days.
In God's eyes the last days started with the death of Jesus and the
founding of the church. There is only two days left before the millennium
from the start of the church so we have always been in the last days in
that sense, but we are truly in the final moments today in our day. Enoch
was the one who was translated by God to heaven as an example of the
rapture. And he is speaking of the second coming of Jesus in the last part
of the verse. All true Christians will return with God to earth at the end
of the great tribulation. (Hebrews 11:5 By faith Enoch was translated that
he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated
him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased
God.) (Revelation 19:14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him
upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.) People often
say that Jude quotes from the unbiblical book of Enoch for verses 6 and
14, but that is not true. Enoch does mention the angels spoken of in verse
6, but it takes from Genesis rather than Jude from it.

(Jude 15 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have
spoken against him.) Jude continues by saying Enoch prophesied of the
coming judgment by God on the ungodly who will try to justify their sin
before a holy God, but God will instead show the ungodly how ungodly they
really are. Jude uses the word ungodly four times in this verse to show
they are completely turned over to Satan and have rejected the gospel as
the number four means gospel.

(Jude 16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons
in admiration because of advantage.) Jude lists various things of these
ungodly men showing how sinful they really are. They seek after the praise
of men instead of the praise of God.

(Jude 17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;) Jude pleads for the church to
remember the words spoken by the apostles about the Lord Jesus Christ
rather than those spoken by these ungodly men.

(Jude 18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last
time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.) Jude continues by
saying there would be mockers of those who follow Jesus Christ in the last
days and that is so true today. These people walk after their own ungodly
lusts rather than follow God and his word.

(Jude 19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not
the Spirit.) Jude continues by showing how they are not saved and do not
have the Spirit living in them. They prefer to purposely separate
themselves from God.

(Jude 20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy
faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,) Jude says for those who are true
Christians to build up themselves by increasing their faith and praying in
the Holy Ghost. (Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing
by the word of God.) We must stay in the word of God in order to grow.
This will help us from falling for false doctrines as taught by these
ungodly men. It is only praying with the help of the Holy Ghost that will
allow us to keep from being deceived. Many Christians fail to pray
especially when it comes to discernment so that they are not deceived.
Jude here contrasts true Christians from the ungodly men spoken of
earlier.

(Jude 21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of
our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.) Jude tells the believers to stay
in the love of God looking for his mercy. Jude says if we love God we will
have eternal life. We see in this verse and in others how Jude refers to
his brother Jesus as the Lord Jesus Christ thus recognizing that he is God
and his Lord and only Saviour. Jude is no longer the unbeliever he was
before the resurrection of Jesus.

(Jude 22 And of some have compassion, making a difference:) Jude says
that the true believers are to have compassion on those who are sincere in
seeking the truth rather than condemning them. We must still give them the
gospel and the truth, but we are to do it lovingly.

(Jude 23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire;
hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.) Others we are to try to
lead to the Lord with hell fire and brimstone preaching. We are to hate
their sin as all sinners and to tell them all about hell. Today many
preachers do not preach on hell. Some people get saved because of the fear
of going to hell and others get saved by other means and that is what Jude
is showing in these last two verses. Different tactics are needed for
different people when preaching the gospel. Some get saved by tracts,
others by reading scripture, and some by the giving of the gospel by a
friend.   

(Jude 24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
joy,) It is only God who can keep us from falling. He always allows a
Christian to have a way out so as not to sin. God never allows us to be
tempted above what we can handle. (I Corinthians 10:13 There hath no
temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful,
who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will
with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear
it.) We will be presented faultless before God at our judgment due to our
sins being washed away by Jesus. It will be with exceeding joy that we are
presented before God.

(Jude 25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,
dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.) Jude concludes by saying
that only God is our Saviour and only he is the wise God. Jude says God
will have glory and majesty, dominion and power forever. He has always had
it, does now, and will continue so forever. We will one day get to see
this glory when we get to heaven.
