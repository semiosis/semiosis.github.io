The Handwriting of God

The handwriting or fingerprint of God is found all over scripture.
Scripture is the inspired, infallible, inerrant word of God and can be
found in English in the King James Bible. Inspired means God breathed or
as he spoke. This is why scripture is called the word of God as it is the
words spoken by God the Holy Ghost to holy men who put it down in writing.
(II Timothy 3:16-17 All scripture is given by inspiration of God,
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness:
17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good
works.) (II Peter 1:20-21 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the
scripture is of any private interpretation.
21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men
of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.) Scripture is referred
to as holy scriptures since it is the very words of God who is holy.
[Romans 1:2 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy
scriptures,)] We saw in II Timothy how scripture is where we get our
doctrines from and scripture is what corrects us of our sins if we obey
it. Inerrant and infallible both mean scripture is without error and is
incapable of having error as it is the very words of God and God is
perfect. II Peter showed how scripture is only the words of God and no
added words of the writers. In fact over 40 different people wrote
scripture over 1,500 years or so (some say close to 2,000 years) and no
part contradicts another part and they all blend together and all of
scripture by all of these men points to one person, the Lord Jesus Christ.
Jesus can be found on every page of scripture if you look for him as the
whole book points to him. All of these men over so many years could not
have blended together the way they did if it was not the hand of God
directing them. All scientific, medical, and historical facts mentioned in
scripture are 100% accurate with no errors. We see how all of scripture
has the handwriting of God on it, but we will see how God's handwriting
goes much deeper than the surface.

Prophecy is one of the things that show that scripture is the word of
God. No other book including so called holy books such as the Koran have
prophecy in them at least certainly on the scale of scripture. Nostradamus
who was a fraud wrote some "prophecies", but they were so vague and never
came to pass. God in scripture on the other hand has lots of prophecy. In
fact 25% of scripture was prophetic at the time it was written. In
scripture there are many prophecies that are so accurate that it appears
as if they were written by someone after the fact. This is because God
already knows the future so for him it has already passed. The Koran would
never have prophecy like in scripture since Satan who is the author of it
cannot see the future. All of prophecy in scripture that has been
fulfilled so far is 100% accurate in every detail just as was written in
scripture. Prophecies of Jesus speak of where he would be born and how he
would be betrayed and many detailed aspects of his life. Cyrus was
mentioned by name over 400 years before he was born that he would allow
the Jews to return to Judah. (Isaiah 44:28 That saith of Cyrus, He is my
shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem,
Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.)

I said that all historical facts in scripture are accurate. Daniel 8
is so accurate that many people try to say that it was written hundreds of
years later than claimed by another man. People just do not want to
believe God. Daniel 8 describes the Medo-Persian Empire, with Persia as
the greater half, conquering the Babylonian Empire and then continues with
Alexander the Great and the Greeks conquering the Medo-Persian Empire and
then the splitting of the Greek Empire into four kingdoms upon the death
of Alexander the Great. This is exactly what happened in history.
Scripture is so accurate on historical facts that archeologists have used
it to search for cities and people mentioned in scripture that people said
were not real. It was by these archeologists that they found historical
evidence that king David, Caiaphas, and others were real as well as the
Hittites and Hivites which people said never existed, but scripture was
proved right. Many facts about Jerusalem and Israel have also been
confirmed. The walls of Jericho were found to have fallen outward just as
scripture says when all other ancient walled cities were found collapsed
inward as the invading army entered. God had the walls of Jericho fall
outward so they could climb over the walls and enter the city. Jesus said
the stones would cry out if the people were silenced when he entered
Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. (Luke 19:40 And he answered and said unto them,
I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would
immediately cry out.) They still cry out today providing evidence that
confirms scripture is of God.  

The Holy Bible speaks of many scientific facts that we now know are
true, but many were not known by scientists until recently. Many early
godly scientists because they believed scripture were able to discover the
things they did. Job has many science facts in it. Job says the earth
hangs upon nothing when people thought something held the earth up. We now
know it hangs in space held up only by God who holds the whole universe
together by Jesus. (Job 26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty
place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.) (Colossians 1:17 And he is
before all things, and by him all things consist.) God said there is a
rainbow in every cloud which we now know is true by using special
equipment. (Genesis 9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud
over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:) God said the
earth is round when scientists long thought the earth was flat. (Isaiah
40:22 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens
as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:) This verse
and many others also say God stretches or expands the heavens which
scientists now know the universe is expanding just as God said. Scripture
mentioned pathways in the oceans long before we knew they existed and
spoke of the hydrological cycle of rain falling and evaporating, forming
clouds, and falling as rain again. (Psalm 8:8 The fowl of the air, and the
fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.)
(Ecclesiastes 1:7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not
full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return
again.) God said life was in the blood which we now know is true. (Genesis
9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye
not eat.) Many more facts deal with lightning, the stars, and other things
that man has only recently learned.

Scripture spoke of germs long before we knew what they were. Even in
the 1800's physicians would touch a dead person and then without washing
their hands they would go and deliver a baby. A third of the moms and
babies were dying. It was only after reading scripture that the start of
washing hands began. The same occurred during the Bubonic Plague of the
1300's in Europe as many were dying they realized the Jews did not seem to
be as affected as non-Jews. The Jews read scripture and washed their
hands. Eventually others followed suit and the plague ended. God spoke
many times about washing in running water to the Israelites. This was to
get rid of the germs. Scripture speaks of using hyssop as a healing agent
which we know works and also of quarantining people with plague or other
diseases so that it will not spread. The sick Israelites were placed
outside of the camp. We now do the same to prevent spreading of diseases.


Scriptures contains evidence of God as the great mathematician. The
value of PI as 3.14 is found accurately in scripture in I Kings 7:23. (I
Kings 7:23 ¶ And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line
of thirty cubits did compass it round about.) Numbers in scripture have
meanings as I have mentioned many times. Many of these meanings can be
seen obviously, but many more are more discreet as God keeps things hidden
to be found by those who truly want to learn and seek out scripture.
(Proverbs 25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour
of kings is to search out a matter.) (Isaiah 48:6 Thou hast heard, see all
this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this
time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.) Sometimes God
reveals a number by counting the items listed in a list or the number of
times that God uses a word in scripture or where a word is found in a
particular chapter or verse. God did inspire even the chapter and verse
numbers as can be seen in the relationship in scripture. The number 23
means death and this is seen in Genesis 23 which is about the death of
Sarah. This chapter contains 23 words related to death. Psalm 23 is about
the valley of the shadow of death. Numbers play a great role in scripture
clearly seen in the number seven. Colors also play a role that often
matches its corresponding number such as seen in Revelation. The color of
a metal or object also reveals the meaning of the number.

Inspired scripture as found in the Hebrew and Greek and including the
King James Bible have a built in dictionary in them. This dictionary is
not found in the modern corrupt bibles showing that it was placed there by
the hand of God. Often times a harder word in scripture will later be
defined again in the same verse using an easier word or the other word
will often be found nearby such as a few verses away, the same chapter, or
book. Occasionally God will make you search harder for it since God
expects his children to study scripture and not just read it and this
forces people to study it. God defines his own words, not man.

The Hebrew scriptures have what is known as the ELS code. There is
some evidence that the Greek scriptures and the King James Bible also
contain them. ELS stands for Equidistant Letter Sequence. Throughout
scripture God placed patterns where if you start with a letter in a word
and count so many letters and continue this same counting pattern that
words are formed that are related to the verse or verses where they are
found. Large works of writing will have some random words, but nothing has
ever been found with the pattern in scripture and the relevance of them to
the surface text. The use of a computer helps find them easier. One
example is Isaiah 53 which is the chapter of Jesus as the suffering
servant who went to the cross for our sins. The ELS bible code reveals in
this chapter the names of Jesus and his disciples as well as names and
things associated with his crucifixion. There is no way these things could
randomly appear and in the location they did. There are many, many ELS
codes that reveal the handwriting of God.

Scriptures contains other hidden codes for those who search them out
such as the name code were God had the people named a certain name from
Adam to Noah and even on down to Jesus. These names put together spell out
the gospel. Another example is how the Israelites formed a cross when they
encamped while wondering in the wilderness. This can be seen by comparing
the census in Numbers with how the tribes were encamped. One other pattern
can be seen in Genesis how the first time a word is mentioned sets the
tone for the rest of scripture. There are other codes or patterns in
scripture as well. The handwriting or signature of God is also found
throughout nature such as DNA, but that is for another sermon.

Three times in scripture the handwriting of God is specifically
mentioned as being written by God besides the many I have just mentioned.
The first time the finger of God wrote in scripture was when God wrote the
ten commandments for Moses to give to the Israelites. God actually wrote
them twice since Moses broke the first tablets. (Exodus 31:18 ¶ And he
gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount
Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger
of God.) (Exodus 32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the
writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.) (Exodus 34:1 And
the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the
first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first
tables, which thou brakest.) We see here how God was able to write on
stone as his fingers literally carved away the stone.

The second time that God wrote with his finger was in Daniel 5 when
the evil Babylonian king Belshazzar was having a big drunken party as he
and the others were drinking wine from the holy objects from the temple
and blaspheming God. The fingers of God appeared and wrote on the wall to
foretell of the soon coming doom of the king and the Babylonian Empire.
This is known as the handwriting on the wall and today we use this phrase
to describe the impending end of something whether a business or a person.
(Daniel 5:5 ¶ In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and
wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the
king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.) (Daniel
5:22-29 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
though thou knewest all this;
23 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have
brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy
wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised
the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see
not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and
whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:
24 Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was
written.

25 ¶ And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
UPHARSIN.
26 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy
kingdom, and finished it.
27 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
28 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
29 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,
and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning
him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.) God destroyed the
king and the nation that very night.

The third time that God wrote in scripture was by Jesus himself when
he wrote on the ground with his finger to the men who brought the woman
that was caught in the act of adultery to him at the temple. Scripture
does not say what he wrote, but Jesus did say that he who was without sin
was to cast the first stone. As Jesus wrote on the ground the older men
left first until eventually they were all gone. It is possible that Jesus
was writing the sins of the men on the ground and they left being
convicted and wanting to leave before Jesus revealed more of their sins to
the other men. Jesus may have shown how they were guilty of breaking the
ten commandments as well or some have said maybe he was writing for them
to reveal the man that sinned with her or he would reveal them as false
witnesses. Whatever he wrote convicted the men. Jesus may have also been
revealing himself as God by writing on the ground just as God wrote on the
tables of stone for Moses. Jesus was at the temple and it is very likely
he was writing on stone again just as he did for Moses. A normal person
cannot write on stone with their finger, only God can. The gospel of John
is also all about showing Jesus is God and this event is not recorded in
any of the other gospels. (John 8:6-8 This they said, tempting him, that
they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger
wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.
7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto
them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.)

Scripture points to the finger of God as scripture has the
handwriting of God all over it and shows it is inspired of God. There are
many more examples I could have given. The sole purpose of scripture is to
point people to Jesus and their need as a sinner for Jesus as their
Saviour and this is what God does by pointing to Jesus with his
handwriting showing that Jesus is God and the only way of salvation.
Search out the holy scriptures and find the handwriting of God. For those
who are not saved, call upon Jesus today before he points a finger at you
and casts you out of his sight with the words that no one wants to hear,
"Depart from me into everlasting fire. I never knew you."
