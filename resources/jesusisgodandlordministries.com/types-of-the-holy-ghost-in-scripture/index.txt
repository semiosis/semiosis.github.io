Types of the Holy Ghost in scripture

The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead and he is the one
who convicts a person to call upon Jesus, convicts a Christian when they
sin, and is the Comforter for Christians. He will teach a person the
meaning of scripture. Just like there are types of God the Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ found in scripture then there are of the Holy Ghost as
well. This should not be a surprise as he is an equal member of the
Godhead. (I John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the
Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.) The Holy
Ghost works behind the scenes and does not bring attention to himself, but
rather to Jesus Christ. The Holy Ghost gave the holy men the words to
write down in scripture and all of scripture is meant to point people to
Jesus after they realize they are a sinner in need of a Saviour.

The first type of the Holy Ghost we will look at is oil. Oil was used
for many things in scripture. The most frequent oil used in scripture was
olive oil and this was used for many purposes such as for sacrifices, oil
in lamps for lighting, for cooking, and for anointing. Joel uses the
reference that a lack of olive oil in the land was really a lack of the
Holy Ghost in the Israelites lives as they had rejected God for false
gods. (Joel 1:10 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is
wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.) Oil was used to
anoint people and objects. The anointing by oil represented that God was
behind the appointment of a person as king or priest or was in full
support of the use of an object such as the tabernacle and the objects
inside it. These items were all to be anointed prior to being used. Once
the anointing was done then God gave the approval as now the Holy Ghost
had made these things holy and separated for God. (Exodus 30:23-29 Take
thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels,
and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels,
and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,
24 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary,
and of oil olive an hin:         
25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound
after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.
26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and
the ark of the testimony,  
27 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels,
and the altar of incense,         
28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and
his foot.
29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever
toucheth them shall be holy.) We see in these verses how these objects are
now holy and so is anything that touches them. Christians are holy since
they are indwelt with the Holy Ghost and have been touched by him just as
if they had had the oil poured upon them. The oil itself does not make
something holy, but rather the fact that it represents the Holy Ghost.
This anointing of oil has been used to cast out devils from a house, but
this must be done with much prayer and fasting.

Oil was also used to anoint the priests, especially the high priest
and was also used to anoint kings showing they were given their authority
by God the Holy Ghost. God placed both righteous and unholy kings into
power and both were anointed which shows how it is God who gives people
their power or takes it away. God will even use a wicked king to serve his
purpose and do his will. Saul was anointed as the first king as he was the
one chosen by God to be king. God did not let the people choose. The
anointing was done by pouring the oil over the head. (Exodus 30:30 And
thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may
minister unto me in the priest's office.) (I Samuel 15:1 Samuel also said
unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people,
over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the
LORD.) God later had David anointed to replace Saul as king due to Saul's
sins. (I Samuel 16:12-13 12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was
ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And
the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.      
13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his
brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day
forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.) We see in verse 13 how
after David was anointed then the Spirit of the LORD came upon David. This
clearly shows how God had chosen David for king and the Holy Ghost was now
with David to guide him as king. Jesus had his feet anointed by a woman of
great sin whom he had forgiven. By anointing Jesus' feet she was
recognizing Jesus as God and Lord. By anointing his feet rather than his
head she was recognizing that she was not worthy to even be in the
presence of God. (Luke 7:37-38 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was
a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house,
brought an alabaster box of ointment, 
38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet
with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his
feet, and anointed them with the ointment.) Jesus was anointed just before
his death by Mary the sister of Lazarus as she was anointing his body
preparing it for death. (Mark 14:3 ¶ And being in Bethany in the house of
Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster
box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and
poured it on his head.) (Mark 14:8 She hath done what she could: she is
come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.) [John 11:2 (It
was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet
with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)]

Oil was used for offerings for God. The oil was mixed with unleavened
bread or wafers. Leaven represents sin so the bread had to have no leaven
or sin and the oil represented the Holy Ghost mixing with Jesus in a
believer's life as only Jesus can remove the sin in a person by washing
them in his blood and the person is only drawn to Jesus to be washed of
their sins by the oil of the Holy Ghost. (Leviticus 2:4 ¶ And if thou
bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or
unleavened wafers anointed with oil.)

Oil was used for healing people as it represents being healed by God.
A person is only healed from sin when they become indwelled with Jesus and
the Holy Ghost. This happens when they are saved by calling on Jesus to
save them. Jesus sent out the apostles to heal people. (Mark 6:13 And they
cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and
healed them.) James said that the elders were to anoint the sick with oil
in order to heal them after praying over them and asking in the name of
the Lord. (James 5:14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders
of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the
name of the Lord:) It is the power of the Holy Ghost represented in the
oil that brings people to the healing power of Jesus.

Oil was used in lamps to give light. These lamps represent Jesus as
the light of the world and the oil the Holy Ghost who brought that light
into the world as a man when he came upon Mary who was a virgin. (Matthew
1:20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not
to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of
the Holy Ghost.) It is the oil of the Holy Ghost that draws us to the
light of Jesus and without that oil you will never be convicted of your
sins and drawn to Jesus. God commanded lamps of pure olive oil to be used
in the lamps in the tabernacle which were to burn continuously. The lamps
had to stay burning as they represented Jesus and without the light of
Jesus we are in darkness of sin. These lamps were a reminder to the
Israelites that they needed Jesus. The oil in the lamps represented the
Holy Ghost pointing them to Jesus and how he as God had anointed Jesus and
given his approval of his work as the Son of God. (Exodus 27:20 ¶ And thou
shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee
pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always.)
Jesus told the parable in Matthew 25 of the ten virgins with five being
wise and five being unwise. The five wise virgins had oil in their lamps
as they were saved and were ready and looking for Jesus whereas the five
unwise virgins did not have oil in their lamps as they were not heeding
the call of the Holy Ghost as they had rejected him and therefore without
the Holy Ghost convicting them then they could not be ready for Jesus when
he came. This is why they had no oil in their lamps as they were not
prepared. Many people today are the same as they put off being saved
thinking they do not need Jesus and they can be saved another day. We are
not guaranteed to have another day. Without the oil of the Holy Ghost you
will never have the light of Jesus and this is what Jesus was saying in
this parable. Wise people get saved. (Matthew 25:3-4 3 They that were
foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:         
4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.) These wise
virgins were looking for the return of Jesus with gladness.

Being anointed by the oil of the Holy Ghost brings gladness as only
the Holy Ghost can bring us close to Jesus and God the Father. The closer
we walk with Jesus then the more gladness we will have in our lives.
(Psalm 45:7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore
God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.) One of the fruits of the Spirit or Holy Ghost is joy as he is
the one who brings us to Jesus who is the joy in a Christian's life.
(Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,) David was glad to have been
anointed with oil by God as he knew this meant the Holy Ghost was in his
life and this would bring goodness and mercy all of his life and he would
get to live with God forever. (Psalm 23:5-6 5 Thou preparest a table
before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head
with oil; my cup runneth over.   
6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.) A saved person should
rejoice that they are saved just like David. The oil of the Holy Ghost
will make a person's face shine as they shine forth Jesus. David
understood this. (Psalm 104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of
man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth
man's heart.)

Water is another type of the Holy Ghost. Jesus described the Holy
Ghost as living water that he would give people after his resurrection.
Just as water is essential for survival, so is the Holy Ghost for without
him we cannot have the living water of Jesus and we would remain lost and
on a path to hell. [John 7:38-39 38 He that believeth on me, as the
scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
39(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should
receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not
yet glorified.)] Water is used for cleansing and this is seen in how the
Holy Ghost is the one who applies the blood of Jesus to our souls. It is
this blood of Jesus that actually washes us away just as water washes away
dirt on our physical bodies. The priests were required to wash before they
performed their duties in the tabernacle and temple. (Exodus 30:18-21 18
Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass,
to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the
congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.    
19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:
20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they
shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the
altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:       
21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and
it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed
throughout their generations.) This was symbolic of being washed in the
blood of Jesus. As I previously stated the Holy Ghost convicts a true born
again believer when they sin so that they will confess their sin and
become clean once again. (I John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.) Naaman the leper was told by Elisha to wash in the
Jordan river to be cleansed. This river represented the Holy Ghost washing
Naaman with the blood of Jesus. Following his washing in the river he
turned to the true God and away from his idols. A person can only do that
by being convicted by the Holy Ghost and then have the Holy Ghost wash a
person's sins away with the shed blood of Jesus Christ. Water baptism
represents a person dying in their sins, being buried, and rising again
with a new life. The water represents the Holy Ghost who cleanses our
hearts just as water cleanses our physical bodies. Baptism represents our
obedience to Jesus and it is the water or the Holy Ghost that brings us to
Jesus and convicts us to obey and serve Jesus.

Just as water has other meanings other than the Holy Ghost such as
destruction as seen in the Genesis flood so does fire. Fire at times is a
type of the Holy Ghost. Fire can be seen as the Lord's approval of a
sacrifice that he burns up such as when God consumed the sacrifice by
Elijah when he had the contest with the prophets of Baal on Mt. Carmel. (I
Kings 18:37-38 37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that
thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back
again.   
38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and
the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water
that was in the trench.) God also consumed by fire the sacrifice of Manoah
the dad of Samson. (Judges 13:19-20 19 So Manoah took a kid with a meat
offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did
wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.
20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the
altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar.
And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the
ground.) Scripture which is God's word specifically from the Holy Ghost is
purified seven times by fire. (Psalm 12:6 The words of the LORD are pure
words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.)
Silver is purified in a fiery furnace just like the words of God that
today are found in English in the King James Bible. The Holy Ghost gave
Jeremiah the words to speak and he made them a fire in his mouth.
(Jeremiah 5:14 Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye
speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this
people wood, and it shall devour them.) The Holy Ghost baptizes people
with fire as seen at the first Pentecost following the resurrection of
Jesus. (Acts 2:3-4 3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as
of fire, and it sat upon each of them.         
4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with
other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.) John the Baptist spoke
of this baptism by fire by the Holy Ghost. (Matthew 3:11 I indeed baptize
you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier
than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost, and with fire:) This fire of the Holy Ghost is what convicts a
believer to confess their sins and for an unsaved person to call upon
Jesus to save them. A person can ignore this conviction. We are warned not
to quench the Holy Ghost as this will keep him from doing his job of
convicting a person. An unsaved person can ignore the call by the Holy
Ghost to get saved one too many times and then it will be too late. (I
Thessalonians 5:19 Quench not the Spirit.) You do not want to extinguish
the fire of the Holy Ghost in your life.

Wind and the breath of God are types of the Holy Ghost. God breathed
into man after he had created Adam. Man cannot come to life until he has
the breath of the Holy Ghost in him. (Genesis 2:7 And the LORD God formed
man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life; and man became a living soul.) Jesus breathed on the apostles
after his resurrection and gave them the Holy Ghost. (John 20:22 And when
he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto
them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:) Jesus compared the Holy Ghost to the
wind in the fact that he goes where he wants to just as the wind does and
just as the wind cannot be seen neither can the Holy Ghost. We can only
see the effects of the wind and hear the wind, but not see it and the Holy
Ghost is the same way. If we let him we will feel the tug of the Holy
Ghost in our lives. (John 3:8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and
whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.) The Holy
Ghost came as a mighty wind on that first Pentecost when he baptized by
fire. (Acts 2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a
rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.)
Just as the wind blows about a ship, the holy men who wrote scripture were
moved by the Holy Ghost. (II Peter 1:21 For the prophecy came not in old
time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by
the Holy Ghost.)   

Another type of the Holy Ghost found in scripture is the dove. The
dove is a very peaceful bird that stays out of fights. The dove has long
been used as a symbol of peace by governments and peace groups. Just like
the dove, the Holy Ghost brings peace into our lives if we listen to him
and obey him in our lives. The Holy Ghost brings peace whereas Satan
brings war and distress. The Holy Ghost appeared as a dove at the baptism
of Jesus. (Luke 3:21-22 21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came
to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was
opened,      
22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him,
and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee
I am well pleased.) The dove was the bird sent out by Noah after the flood
to see if the ground was dried up. The dove brought back an olive leaf.
The olive branch has also long been a sign of peace and God was showing he
approved of Noah and his family and was at peace with them by bringing
them the olive leaf. We already saw how olive oil also represents the Holy
Ghost. (Genesis 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo,
in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters
were abated from off the earth.) The dove was a clean bird that was used
for sin and burnt offerings as the Holy Ghost brings us cleanness by
washing us in Jesus' blood. (Leviticus 5:7 And if he be not able to bring
a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed,
two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin
offering, and the other for a burnt offering.) Noah had also sent out the
raven, but as an unclean bird it never returned.

The Holy Ghost represents the gifts that we will receive in heaven.
As a child of God we have access to all of Jesus' treasures as joint heirs
with Jesus. (Romans 8:17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God,
and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may
be also glorified together.) Rebekah was given an earring and bracelets by
Abraham's servant as a token of the wealth she would get if she married
Isaac. (Genesis 24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou?
And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto
him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her
hands.)

One last type of the Holy Ghost that we will look at is Abraham's
servant as seen in Genesis 24. This is the servant that was sent by
Abraham to find a bride for his son Isaac. This is when he finds Rebekah
and gives her the jewelry and brings her back to Isaac to be his wife. The
servant gives her much jewelry to show her that nothing is too much for
the bride of Jesus and that all that belongs to the Son Jesus also belongs
to the bride the church. (Galatians 4:7 Wherefore thou art no more
a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.)
Genesis 23 saw the death of Sarah, but chapter 24 brings life in Jesus
which Rebekah readily accepts by going to Isaac who was a type of Jesus.
She left immediately and did not stick around with her family as they
wanted her to do. The servant said she needed to go to Isaac right away
just as we must not wait to go to Jesus, but go when we are convicted by
the Holy Ghost. Verse 28 of the chapter shows Rebekah ran to tell others
about the servant. This shows she was excited to tell others about Jesus.
In verse 65 Rebekah covers her face with a veil when she sees Isaac. This
represents how we as the bride cannot look at Jesus in his full glory
without our face covered in a veil and how we do not deserve to be called
the bride of Jesus. The servant was Abraham's eldest servant and was most
likely Eleazar, but God never gives the servant a name in this chapter. I
believe this was done intentionally by God to match the type of the Holy
Ghost. Abraham was a type of God the Father [See my sermon Abraham the
obedient father and type of God the Father.] and Isaac was a type of his
Son Jesus Christ and as I said Abraham's servant in this chapter was a
type of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is the one who brings people to
Jesus and for those who become saved since Pentecost then they now become
a part of the true church whether they actually attend a physical church
or not and regardless of denomination or non-denomination. The true church
is the bride of Jesus and Rebekah became the bride of Isaac and represents
the church. Just as the Holy Ghost brings the bride (the church) to Jesus,
Abraham's servant as a type of the Holy Ghost brought the bride of Rebekah
(the church) to Isaac who represents Jesus. The servant was not given a
name in chapter 24 as the focus was on Rebekah as the bride going to meet
her bridegroom Isaac. The Holy Ghost is the same way by staying in the
background and always placing the focusing on Jesus the bridegroom rather
than on himself. The Holy Ghost always points people to Jesus rather than
himself. Genesis 24 is 67 verses long showing how much God places on the
importance of his bride the church. Just as the servant was sent far away
from Abraham and his son Isaac in order to find a suitable bride, the Holy
Ghost also goes throughout the world convicting anyone who will listen so
that they too may become a part of the church and the bride of Jesus
Christ. The servant proudly told Rebekah about Abraham and specifically
Isaac. This is representative of telling people about Jesus of which we
should all be doing. This is what the Holy Ghost does as he leads people
to hear about Jesus if they are willing to listen.  

We have seen various types of the Holy Ghost as found in scripture
and just as the Holy Ghost calls everyone to be saved and become a part of
the church and the bride of Jesus, I too plead with anyone who is
listening that is not saved that they too may repent of their sins and
call upon Jesus today to be their Saviour. Do not grieve the Holy Ghost by
rejecting his offer to be a part of the bride of Christ. (Ephesians 4:30
And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day
of redemption.) This verse shows how if we get saved then we will be
sealed forever as the bride of Jesus. Turn to Jesus today and be saved.
