Dangers of Calvinism

There are two main views of theology known as Calvinism and
Arminianism with each having five points. A third view is Lutheranism from
former Roman Catholic priest Martin Luther who led to the Protestant
Reformation. This view is found mainly only in Lutheran churches.
Calvinism came about in the 1500's by French theologian John Calvin and
Arminianism in 1610 by Dutch Reform theologian Jacobus Arminius. All three
are wrong with Arminianism being the closest to biblical truth and with
Calvinism being very dangerous. Each of the three contains some truth, but
also wrong doctrines. Baptists since the 1600's have long been associated
with Arminianism over Calvinism since it was the most biblical, though as
I said all are wrong and one needs to just follow scripture. Methodists
and Pentecostals are also heavily Arminian with Presbyterians being
Calvinistic. Reform denominations are also heavily Calvinistic. Today many
Baptists and especially Southern Baptist leaders and preachers have gotten
away from scripture due to using false corrupt bibles and have been
pushing the false and dangerous Calvinism. The Southern Baptist bible the
Christian Standard Bible (CSB), formerly known as the Holman Christian
Standard Bible (HCSB), even makes changes in the text to support
Calvinism. John Calvin was a Roman Catholic who broke away and started
Calvinism as an alternative view of Lutheranism and as a competing
denomination. We should never follow the doctrines named after a man,
follow God's word.

The five points of Arminianism are Free Will, Conditional Election,
Unlimited Atonement, Resistible Grace, and Falling From Grace. Sometimes
the acronym DAISY is used with slightly different wording.

The five points of Lutheranism are Original Sin, Unconditional
Election, Unlimited Atonement, Resistible Grace, and Falling From Grace.  

The five points of Calvinism are known by the acronym TULIP. Some
people are said to be five point Calvinists or five point Arminianists or
three point Calvinists and two point Arminianists or some combination.
Some people call a certain combination of the two the five points of
Evangelicalism. I am not anything as I just go by scripture as we all
should. The TULIP acronym stands for Total Depravity, Unconditional
Election, Limited Atonement, Irresistible Grace, and Perseverance of the
Saints.

Total Depravity teaches that man due to Adam and Eve's sin is totally
depraved, spiritually dead and cannot repent. Calvinism says God must
initiate the work in order to save a person. It is true that all people
are born with a sin nature due to Adam's sin and all are born spiritually
dead, but it is not true that we cannot repent and be saved. It is true
that man cannot save themselves, but not true that everyone cannot call
out to Jesus for salvation. Arminianism says we have a free will to choose
to obey the Holy Ghost and to repent or not. Most people never do get
saved because they ignore the conviction by the Holy Ghost, but not due to
not being an elect or because they cannot repent. Lutheranism calls this
Original Sin which is a term taken from Roman Catholicism. Scripture says
the Holy Ghost convicts people that they are a sinner in need of a Saviour
as they are unable to save themselves. Man will not call out to Jesus
without conviction by the Holy Ghost, but the Holy Ghost convicts everyone
and not just certain people as Calvinism teachings. (Romans 3:10-11 As it
is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
11There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.)
Every person can choose to repent of their sins if they want. Both John
the Baptist and Jesus preached that people needed to repent. (Mark 1:14-15
14 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand:
repent ye, and believe the gospel.) Jesus never said that unless I allow
you too, then you cannot repent as taught by Calvinism. Jesus would not
preach repentance nor have others preach repentance if man was unable to
repent. Jesus calls out for all to repent, not just a few. (II Peter 3:9
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness;
but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but
that all should come to repentance.) True biblical repentance is realizing
that something is sin in the same way that God sees it as sin. You are to
then stop doing it. If someone is unsaved then they need to call out to
Jesus to save them before changing their lives. True repentance is not as
many teach that we need to change our lives before we are saved. God will
save us just as we are, the filthy wretched sinners that we are. God will
clean us up after we are saved by the Holy Ghost convicting us of sin and
us then repenting of the sin and not doing it anymore. If we had to change
before being saved, then few would be saved and that is works salvation.
We cannot clean up ourselves since we are sinners and that is the whole
point of why we need Jesus as our Saviour. All of us are as filthy rags.
(Isaiah 64:6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our
iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.)

Unconditional Election says that people did nothing on their own to
be elected by God for their salvation. Calvinism says that God elects
people for salvation based on his will and nothing that the sinner has
done whereas Arminianism says that God foreknew who would believe on Jesus
before the foundation of the world and therefore they are elected for
salvation due to the fact that they chose Jesus as their Saviour.
Scripture says we are the elect of God since we chose Jesus as our
Saviour, not because he just decided to choose us over someone else. God
knew who would get saved before the foundation of the world and so he knew
who would be the elect, but he never prohibited all people from being the
elect. (I Peter 1:2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the
Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be
multiplied.) (Ephesians 1:4-5 4 According as he hath chosen us in him
before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without
blame before him in love:
5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,) Ephesians 1:4-5
means that God knew who would be saved, but he never prevented someone who
wanted to be saved from being saved as many places in scripture show. We
are predestinated in the sense that God being omniscient knows who will be
saved even before they are born but he does not force anyone to be saved
or prevent someone who truly wants to be saved. It is true that we do not
have to do anything to be saved, but we do need to realize that we are a
sinner and call upon Jesus to save us or else we will not be saved. You
are not just saved because you are one of the elect. You are one of the
elect because you are saved. The idea of only the elect being saved can be
seen in changes made in modern bibles in verses such as Luke 2:14 where
modern bibles change "good will toward men" to phrases such as "to those
with whom God is pleased [NLT (NASB is similar)]", "to those on whom his
favor rests [NIV]", and "men of goodwill [Roman Catholic bibles, NWT]. All
Roman Catholic bibles have some Calvinism in them. I Thessalonians 1:4 is
another verse often changed by modern bibles to show God chose people
rather than we choose God by free will. God does convict us that we our
sinners who need a Saviour, but we must decide to choose Jesus or reject
him. Jesus does not force himself on anyone who does not want him. Many
people do not choose God, but instead Satan. Jesus died for all, not just
those who please him as in reality none of us please him enough to deserve
salvation. (Luke 2:14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good will toward men.)  

Limited Atonement is the belief that Jesus only died on the cross for
a limited number of people, only his elect rather than for all people.
Scripture is clear that Jesus died for everyone and not just for his elect
that he knew would get saved. This is dangerous teaching as this leads
people not to witness to certain people believing they were not one of the
elect so it is just a waste of time. Arminianism says that he died for
everyone just as scripture says. Satan wants people to believe that they
cannot be saved no matter how much they desire to be. Satan also casts
doubt into people on being assured they are saved. I John 5:13 says we can
know we are saved. (I John 5:13 These things have I written unto you that
believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have
eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.) I
John 2:2 is clear that Jesus died on the cross not just for those he knew
would get saved, but for the whole world meaning everyone. (I John 2:2 And
he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for
the sins of the whole world.) (II Corinthians 5:14-15 14 For the love of
Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all,
then were all dead:
15 And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth
live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.)

Irresistible Grace says that all of those who are elected by God
cannot refuse the grace that God gave them and they will be saved no
matter what. Arminianism says that man has a free will and can refuse the
grace of God. Scripture says that God gave man a free will and he can
freely accept the free gift of God to receive his Son Jesus as their
Saviour or he can freely reject the grace of God and die in their sins.
All people can receive this grace of God, not just the elect. It is true
that we are saved by grace, but those of us who are saved and part of the
elect of God had to choose to receive Jesus as Saviour and did not just
automatically be saved just because we are one of the elect. We could have
refused the grace. [Ephesians 2:5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath
quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)] (Ephesians
2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:
it is the gift of God:) This teaching by Calvinism along with the other
false teachings such as limited atonement can make people say that no
matter what they cannot be saved or for an unsaved person to say that
there is no need to call upon Jesus because if I have been chosen by God
as one of his elect then I will still be saved even if I do nothing. This
is similar to many Jews believing since they are God's chosen people then
they get a free guaranteed ride to heaven. This is not true as they must
call on Jesus the same as everyone else. No one is saved without admitting
they are a sinner and calling upon Jesus including the so called elect of
Calvinism. God called all people to salvation, just that most people
reject Jesus. (Matthew 22:14 For many are called, but few are chosen.)
(John 3:18 ¶ He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that
believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the
name of the only begotten Son of God.)

Calvinism is correct in its fifth point of Perseverance of the Saints
with Arminianism wrong with its fall from grace. Calvinism teaches that
once you are saved you cannot lose that salvation since you are one of the
elect. Arminianism says that a person can fall from grace and lose their
salvation. Scripture is clear that for all who are truly saved and washed
in the blood of Jesus, then they cannot lose their salvation. It is true
that a person can backslide and move away from God and not be as strong or
faithful of a Christian that they once were, but if they were truly saved
then you cannot lose your salvation. Many places show this. (John 3:16 ¶
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.)
(John 5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come
into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.) (John 6:47 Verily,
verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.)
Jesus said in all of these verses that those who believed on him as their
Saviour will have everlasting life. Everlasting means it lasts forever and
cannot be lost. Nearly all denominations including some Baptist ones
preach that you can lose your salvation, but scripture is clear that you
cannot. You cannot have everlasting life if you can lose it and if this
was true then Jesus would be a liar and a sinner and could not be our
Saviour. This does not mean that Christians have free reign to sin though.
(Romans 6:15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law,
but under grace? God forbid.) Most modern bibles show this false belief by
saying "are being saved" instead of "saved" which not only shows work
salvation but also that a person could potentially lose their salvation.


Calvinism is dangerous in that it teaches that only certain people
are elect and that Jesus died on the cross only for these people and that
if you are one of the elect then you will be saved automatically due to
nothing you do and for those who are not saved but desire to be then
unless they are one of the elect then they cannot be saved no matter how
sincere they are since Calvinism teaches that people cannot repent even
though Jesus taught repentance. Scripture clearly shows these doctrines
are wrong as it says that we do not do anything to save ourselves, but we
must call out to Jesus to save us. If a person never does that then they
will die in their sins. Scripture says we can repent and that Jesus died
for all people, but that most would reject him as their Saviour. It is
this calling out to Jesus that makes us one of the elect, not because
Jesus only allowed us to be saved and no one else. Jesus desires that all
be saved as we saw in II Peter 3:9. Stay clear of the dangerous teachings
of Calvinism which are anti-scriptural and will lead many to hell. For
those who are not saved, call upon Jesus today as he will save you so that
you too may become one of the elect that he foreknew.
