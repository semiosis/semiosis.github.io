Work is from God

Americans celebrate Labor Day on the first Monday in September. This
is a day set aside to honour workers who labor hard all year long. Labor
Day was first celebrated as a federal holiday in 1894, but previously was
celebrated by 30 states with the first in 1887 by Oregon. Canada also
celebrates Labour Day on the first Monday in September and more than 80
nations celebrate International Worker's Day on May 1. Labor Day weekend
is considered the unofficial end of summer with summer having unofficially
started on Memorial Day weekend. It was often said that a person was not
to wear white after Labor Day and many still do not today. I personally
think this is foolish. It is good to remember American workers and those
around the world. People working are what keep this nation running and
thriving.

Work is ordained by God and therefore people need to do some kind of
work if they are able to and not expect a free handout. No matter what
your disability is, most people can do some type of work. Work keeps us
busy and away from trouble and sin. Idle time is often said to be of the
devil and that is often true as the non-worker has too much time on their
hands and gets bored and then seeks trouble and sin. Many often think of
work as a burden, punishment, or curse from God, but in reality it is a
blessing especially when doing work for God. Many liberals today are
trying to attack God's command for man to work by telling them not to work
and just let the government or the rich take care of them. This is
socialism and is from Satan, not God. God said that if a person does not
work they do not eat. (II Thessalonians 3:10 For even when we were with
you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he
eat.) God himself worked so why does man think they do not have to work.
(Genesis 2:2-3 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had
made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had
made.
3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it
he had rested from all his work which God created and made.) Christians
need to remember when they are at work and may have a job they do not
like, that we work for God and not our earthly boss. We need to always
give our best even when our coworkers may not be. Let the boss see Jesus
in your work and always have a strong work ethic. (Colossians 3:23-24 And
whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;

24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.) We can see work as drudgery or
we can see it for what it was intended as a "gift of God". (Ecclesiastes
3:13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of
all his labour, it is the gift of God.) (Ecclesiastes 5:19 Every man also
to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat
thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is
the gift of God.)  

From the very beginning God put man to work and expects for each of
us to continue to work. After God created Adam the first person, he placed
him in the garden of Eden to till, dress, and keep the garden. (Genesis
2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every
herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to
rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.) (Genesis
2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to
dress it and to keep it.) Prior to Adam's sin, work was intended to be
easy, but his sin put a curse on the ground and today work is often hard.
(Genesis 3:17-19 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto
the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded
thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt
eat the herb of the field;
19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto
the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto
dust shalt thou return.) With sin came harder work, but God still said we
had to work. Genesis 2 clearly shows how man was working prior to the sin
of man, so this proves that work is not a curse from God due to sin. Even
Genesis 3:17 after the curse says the ground is cursed for thy sake
showing how even hard work is meant for us as good. It builds muscles and
keeps us in shape and our minds in working order. Often when people
retire, they just sit around and their bodies start to decay and they soon
die. Even in retirement, people need to continue to work in a garden or
something to keep them busy and occupied or they will soon die. If retired
do something for the Lord. God never in scripture talks of retirement. We
must work for God until the day we die. This applies to those in the
ministry as well. If God has called you to be a pastor or missionary, you
do not retire just because you are getting older and have done it for so
many years. God called you to the ministry until the day you die. Some
people have gotten saved after they turned to Jesus after a life of hard
work so the curse truly was "for thy sake" for these people. God will
still have work for people to do in the new earth as his servants will
serve him. What this work entails scripture does not say, but it will be a
pleasure to serve God. (Revelation 22:3 And there shall be no more curse:
but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants
shall serve him:) People will also work during the millennium as many
Christians will be rulers in various forms helping Jesus rule the kingdom.
(Revelation 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be
priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.)
Other Christians may be witnessing for Jesus and Christians still with
their natural bodies will most likely be working on farms or other types
of jobs as they do today. Man was intended to work six days and then rest
and worship Jesus on the seventh. This again shows that God wants people
working. (Exodus 20:9 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and
wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,
and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.) (Exodus 23:12 Six
days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that
thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the
stranger, may be refreshed.)

God expects Christians to work for him. God calls some to work for
him in the ministry full time and others God has working a secular job.
Those that God has working a job still need to work for God besides their
earthly job. All Christians need to be witnessing for Jesus whether by
talking to people, handing out tracts, making movies for Jesus, radio,
television, or internet ministries or whatever means God tells you to do.
This includes the disabled who may not be able to work a secular job. God
can use you in some way to reach someone whether you call people on the
phone and witness to them or some other job God may have for you. All can
pray. Doing work for God should be a pleasure and not a burden as a
person's secular job may be. God said the harvest is ripe as the time
nears before his return. God expects us to take advantage of this harvest
and win as many souls for him as we can while we have time. (Luke 10:2
Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers
are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send
forth labourers into his harvest.) (John 4:35 Say not ye, There are yet
four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your
eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.) Too
many Christians disobey God and do no work for him. Let no one listening
today be one of those Christians. God said he would not forget the work
that we do for him. (Hebrews 6:10 For God is not unrighteous to forget
your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in
that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.) As Hebrews 6:10
says, our work we do for God should be a labour of love, not begrudging
work. We should work for God because we love him. (Matthew 25:21 His lord
said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been
faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter
thou into the joy of thy lord.) (Revelation 22:12 And, behold, I come
quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work
shall be.) What we do for the Lord today will determine what we do for him
during the millennial reign of Jesus and during eternity. The more we do
for Jesus today, the more responsibility we will get later. God expects
Christians to walk worthy of the Lord in the way we live, work, and do for
him. (Colossians 1:10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the
knowledge of God;) A Christian can increase in the knowledge of God by
studying the word of God [scripture]. Christians do not spend all of your
time working here on earth for something that will burn up, but rather for
Jesus and things that will last for eternity. Make sure you have time for
Jesus and work for him. For the unsaved person this also applies, but you
need to get saved so you can do work that counts toward eternity. The meat
that does not perish is the meat that Jesus will give to those who are
saved and serve him willingly and with a loving heart. (John 6:27 Labour
not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto
everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath
God the Father sealed.)

Let us work for the Lord while there is still time, for the time will
come when we can no longer do work for God. We must witness while it is
still day and we have the freedom. Sometimes God will close a door in a
nation and make getting the gospel out very difficult and someday the
rapture will come and we will not be able to witness anymore. The night
will have come. Jesus warned us of this. (John 9:4 I must work the works
of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can
work.)

Christians in the Holy Bible worked for God such as Moses who led
God's people out of Egypt, the prophets who preached for God, and the
apostles who started the church. (I Thessalonians 2:9 For ye remember,
brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we
would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel
of God.) (II Thessalonians 3:8 Neither did we eat any man's bread for
nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might
not be chargeable to any of you:) Jesus himself worked as a carpenter
before starting his ministry and performed many miracles which were the
work of his Father as well as much other work for God the Father. (Mark
6:3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and
Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And
they were offended at him.) (John 5:17 ¶ But Jesus answered them, My
Father worketh hitherto, and I work.) Jesus did his greatest work when he
died on the cross so that all people might have everlasting life and
finished the work of the Father. (John 4:34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat
is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.)  

For the person whose burden is heavy whether from sorrow, pain,
grief, fear, worry, but most of all sin, turn to Jesus. (Matthew 11:28-30
¶ Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest.
29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.) If you are unsaved, admit
that you are a sinner and believe that Jesus can save you and then call
upon Jesus to save you and give you everlasting life by entering your
heart and living there. If you do so Jesus will carry your burden and your
soul will have rest. Jesus said that a person was to do the work of God
and that work was to believe in Jesus and the work he did on the cross for
each and every one of us. Believing in the work of the cross will bring
you salvation. (John 6:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the
work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.) For the Christian
who has a heavy burden, call upon Jesus and he will also carry yours. The
closer a Christian walks with Jesus, the lighter their burden will become.
This does not mean that a Christian will not still have sorrow, grief,
pain, fear, and worry in their lives, but with Jesus in our lives it is
much easier to bear them when they come. With Jesus a Christian will
always get through it in some way even if that means God will take them
home to him to ease their pain. Jesus said for a Christian to deny himself
and take up his cross and follow him. (Matthew 16:24 ¶ Then said Jesus
unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself,
and take up his cross, and follow me.) Jesus was saying to always put
Jesus first in your life and to be willing to die for him. A person that
is willing to do that will walk close to God and the closer you walk with
God, the more Jesus will lighten the load of your burden. By trusting in
Jesus we can eliminate worry as we know that Jesus will do what is best
for us. Worry is a sin. By trusting in Jesus a person can enter into the
rest of Jesus. (Hebrews 4:10-11 For he that is entered into his rest, he
also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall
after the same example of unbelief.) Labor Day may be set apart for the
worker to have rest, but a person can only have true rest when they have
Jesus as their Saviour and for those who are saved when they fully trust
in Jesus to lead their lives. This does not mean we will not have to
physically work, but that the burden will be light and those trusting in
Jesus will have rest in eternity as they enjoy worshipping and serving God
rather than suffering everlasting torment in the lake of fire. May
everyone seek the true rest of Jesus. Christians start serving the Lord if
you are not and if you are unsaved, get saved today.
