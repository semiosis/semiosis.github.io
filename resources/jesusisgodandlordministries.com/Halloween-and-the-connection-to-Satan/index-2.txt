Halloween and the connection to Satan

Halloween has always been connected to Satan and is an invitation to
the occult and witchcraft. It should be obvious to every Christian that
Halloween does not bring glory to God, but rather Satan. The origins of
Halloween go back over 2000 years to the Celtic holiday of Samhain
(pronounced sow-in) and possibly to even before the tower of babel and the
dispersion of people. Many cultures have had similar days so they all
might have gotten it from when they were together before being scattered
after the change of languages at the tower of Babel. The Celts lived in
ancient Britain and Ireland. The Celts whose leaders were the high priests
known as Druids have influenced all things in the occult. The Druids were
sold out to Satan and were very wicked and are considered the leaders of
the occult. Samhain was celebrated on November 1 as the death of summer.
On this night the Druids sacrificed people including first born children
and also animals to Baal (Satan). Baal worship is probably condemned more
by God in scripture than any other false god. On October 31 the Druids
went house to house to grab people for sacrifices and often left a
jack-o-lantern to protect the house from death devils coming back. It was
a night meant to celebrate death and hell. Large bonfires were burned and
the people danced around them while wearing masks in attempts to scare off
the evil spirits. Samhain was meant as a day to honor the lord of the dead
or Satan. The Celts prepared "treats" for the evil spirits so they would
not perform "tricks" on them. This has led to our modern trick or treat.

The modern version of Halloween comes from the Roman Catholic Church
when as Pope Gregory I attempted to spread Roman Catholicism throughout
Britain and Ireland he ordered his missionaries in A.D. 601 to secretly
convert the Druid rituals into Roman Catholic rituals. The Roman Catholic
Church has a history of doing this type of thing. Samhain became All
Hallows Day or All Saints Day, a day to celebrate and prayer to "Church
saints". God condemns praying to the dead. Those who are dead cannot help
us and by contacting the dead you are only contacting devils. (Deuteronomy
18:11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or
a necromancer.) As Christians we need to be celebrating Jesus, not
supposed dead saints. God never commanded us to celebrate the saints in
scripture. October 31 became known as All Hallows Eve and eventually
Halloween. The word hallow in Halloween means holy and thus Halloween
means holy evening. God said his name was holy or hallowed yet Satan has
made his day holy as a mockery of God the Father. (Matthew 6:9 After this
manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy
name.) Pope Gregory IV in 835 gave his blessings on All Hallows Eve or
Halloween and made All Saints Day as a day of obligation for Roman
Catholics to attend Mass. The Roman Catholic Church wanted her people to
secretly worship Satan by using Halloween as a deception. The Roman
Catholic Church later added November 2 as All Souls Day to keep the death
theme alive and has solely been responsible for the continual celebration
of Halloween today. Halloween was brought to the United States by the
Irish Catholics and English and Scottish Anglicans.

Halloween is the most holy day for Satanists. This is one of the days
along with Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, and as close as possible to
the first day of spring, summer, fall, and winter so they could desecrate
God's ordained seasons that Satanists are required to make a sacrifice to
Satan, preferably a person, but if unable an animal usually a cat [black
if possible, though they really want a white cat according to former
Satanists as it represents the purity of Jesus who they want to sacrifice]
is made. Jesus is associated with a lion and Satan always tries to copy
things of Jesus and distort them and he is also associated with a lion. It
makes you wonder if the reason they most often sacrifice cats and not dogs
is because it is symbolic of sacrificing Jesus as the Lion of the tribe of
Juda (Revelation 5:5) to Satan who is a roaring lion (I Peter 5:8) and
devours his prey. Is this why so many people are dog lovers and not cat
lovers as the cat reminds them of Jesus? Dogs in scripture are always
negative. Many people especially children that go missing and are never
found are suspected of being used by Satanists for such sacrifices. Often
times a female Satanist will become pregnant just for the sole purpose to
sacrifice her baby to Satan. Others will purposely have an abortion on
Halloween as a sacrifice. Sometimes a Satanist who is attempting to get
out of Satanism or is disobedient to Satan will himself be sacrificed. One
way Satanists have made sacrifices on Halloween is to put items in the
candy to harm or kill children. This was especially bad in the 1970's with
razor blades, pins, and glass in apples and with poisoned or drug injected
candy. Satanists at the highest level will often get a personal appearance
by Satan on Halloween as they perform their sacrifice. This is a night
filled with sex and violence. Notice how the real Halloween always starts
at dark. Satan loves the dark as do sinners. (John 3:19 And this is the
condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness
rather than light, because their deeds were evil.)

Halloween is often thought of as a harmless day of fun and candy. A
day that a child or adult can dress up as anything they want. Many
Christians have sadly embraced this satanic holy day and see no problem
with it. They dress up like the unsaved in evil costumes, carve
Jack-o-lanterns, and put out Halloween decorations with excitement looking
forward to the day just like the heathen. Christians often wonder why
there is no revival in this nation or the world. The reason is because
they cannot even see the evil of Halloween or see the footprints of Satan
all over it. Most Christians are spiritually blind to the work of Satan
and go along with it. Halloween is a time when people dress up as witches,
ghosts, the devil, werewolves, zombies, grim reaper, skeletons, and other
satanic things. Masks are often worn. Satanists love to wear masks
thinking they are hiding their identity from evil spirits. This is why
they are pushing so hard to make everyone wear masks during this plandemic
even when they do no good and have been proven unnecessary. Masks were
often worn on Halloween to try and ward off the evil spirits. Many real
witches have dressed up in disguise to go out and cast spells on places or
people. God said to kill witches. (Exodus 22:18 ¶ Thou shalt not suffer a
witch to live.) This day is used for people to cross dress, males as
females and females as males. God hates this and calls it an abomination.
(Deuteronomy 22:5 ¶ The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a
man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are
abomination unto the LORD thy God.) The homosexual movement got its
momentum going from this day as major cities such as New York City,
Washington, D.C., New Orleans and San Francisco had large gatherings of
cross dressers and of homosexuals dressed in costumes who would publicly
perform homosexual acts without anyone knowing. Halloween has a long
history of connection with homosexuality as much was performed on this
night by Satanists. New York City has the largest Halloween parade. It has
been said that it was the homosexual community that spread adults dressing
up in costumes on Halloween. People often put up Halloween decorations a
month and a half or more before Halloween. Many of the decorations put up
on Halloween are similar to the costumes and often include things such as
Satan, witches and brooms [brooms represent astral projecting), black
cats, spiders and cobwebs, skeletons, skulls, vampires, grip reapers
(death), ghosts (evil spirits), owls , jack-o-lanterns and many other
things associated with Satan. Sadly many Christians go along with
decorating their homes as well as do some churches. Halloween long has had
a history of crime and violence associated with it including arson and
murder. Halloween has always glorified death. God said those who love
death hate him. (Proverbs 8:36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his
own soul: all they that hate me love death.) The leader of Halloween
parades is Death. Satan is Death. (Revelation 6:8 And I looked, and behold
a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed
with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth,
to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts
of the earth.) Satanists always glorify death and darkness. No Christian
should ever participate in Halloween except to use Halloween as an
opportunity to beat Satan at his own game. This is the one day a year that
children will freely come to your door rather than you having to go to
them. Give them a gospel tract along with candy so that they will have an
opportunity to hear about Jesus. I recommend Chick tracts which are little
comic books with the gospel. Children and adults love comic books. Many of
these children do not go to church and this will be the first time they
hear the truth about Jesus. There is no point in participating in
Halloween if you are not going to give the children the gospel. Many
churches sadly close on Halloween night if it falls on a Sunday falling
right into the hand of Satan. Many churches today have "Fall Festivals" on
Halloween with trunk or treat. I am not a huge fan of those as they are
often Halloween under just another name, but if it is done right it can be
a time of a true harvest of souls for Jesus. If a church is going to have
one and the people insist on wearing costumes then have them dress up as a
Bible character in the appropriate sex and make sure the children that
come hear stories about Jesus and the characters and how God commanded the
Israelites to remember their fall harvest. Have teachers there to tell the
children the truth about Halloween and the connection to Satan and how God
hates witches and the other things associated with Halloween. (Jude 23 And
others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the
garment spotted by the flesh.) Along with preferably healthy treats for
the children, make sure they go home with a tract and if the church can
afford it a King James Bible. Often times the parents will read the tract
as well. Invite the parents to come with their children to church. Use
Halloween for the Lord rather than for Satan. Let us turn the table on
Satan's day for Jesus.

Halloween is quickly becoming the most popular holiday in the United
States second only to Christmas and quickly gaining on it. More money is
spent on Halloween except for Christmas. How sad that much of this money
is by Christians. Halloween is often spent not only dressing up in
costumes and trick or treating, but watching scary horror movies that are
satanic in nature, playing pranks, lighting bon fires [reminiscent of the
Druids], carving jack-o-lanterns, bobbing for apples, going to haunted
houses, and playing divination games. Some light candles to put on the
graves of the dead. These things are all connected to Satan by the true
meaning of Halloween. God told Christians not to be like the world. We are
not to love evil or appear like evil to the world. (I Thessalonians 5:22
Abstain from all appearance of evil.) (III John 11 Beloved, follow not
that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God:
but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.) Halloween and New Year's Eve
are the two main holidays celebrated at night and often involve sinful
activities. Christmas Eve does on a smaller scale with Santa Claus and the
drinking, but Halloween is the main night holiday. As Christians we are to
be children of the day, not the night. (I Thessalonians 5:5 Ye are all the
children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night,
nor of darkness.) Darkness is not only absence of physical light, but also
moral light. (Ephesians 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful
works of darkness, but rather reprove them.) God said in Ephesians 5:11 to
reprove the works of darkness and Satan. Reprove means to refute or expose
and that is what I am doing with this sermon and exposing how Halloween is
satanic and should be avoided by everyone especially Christians. God told
the Israelites in Ezekiel 20:7 to cast away the abominations and idols of
Egypt, but this also applies to the abominations from Ireland we have
today in Halloween. The Irish are descended from the Celtics. Jesus said
the harvest is plenteous and he needs harvesters to win souls. I need help
in exposing the evil satanic Halloween. (Matthew 9:37-38 Then saith he
unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are
few;
38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth
labourers into his harvest.)

Orange and black are the two colors most associated with Halloween.
The orange is said to represent the fall harvest and the black the evil
spirits of Samhain or devils and are said to have been chosen since they
represent opposites. Satan wants to harvest as many souls with him as he
can in hell and those who follow Satan will see everlasting death. These
colors are fitting for such a satanic holiday. In scripture orange
represents God's judgment and fire and black represents death and famine.
Satanists are spiritually dead as are all unbelievers and have a famine
from God. Death and everlasting judgment in the lake of fire will be were
the Satanists will end up if they do not repent and call upon Jesus to
save them.  

Trick or treating came about from the Celts who made treats for the
evil spirits hoping when they came they would accept them rather than play
"tricks" on them, in other words harm or kill them. This is also why they
wore masks to try and hide from the evil spirits. Masks were also worn at
times to try and get a devil to possess them.

Bobbing for apples comes from the Druids who highly valued apple
magic.

Jack-o-lanterns are derived from the Druids and Celts who decorated
houses with heads of people they had killed. The original jack-o-lanterns
were skulls that were hollowed out and a lighted candle made of people fat
was placed inside them. It was believed the spirit of a person lived in
their head. Later on pumpkins replaced actual skulls and then faces were
carved in them and a candle placed inside them as a replica of the former
skull and candle. The head and the candle represented death and the spirit
world.

The Celtics often wore masks of false gods and devils that they
believed allowed them to temporarily take on the qualities of that god or
devil.

Bats and blood were often used by the Druids in casting spells and it
was believed that devils would possess these bats. They often used black
cats that were said to be Satan himself. The Druids believed owls were
possessed by devils and traveled with witches and their cats. Some said
the owls were witches in disguise. Owls have had a long association with
Satan. The Romans called owls "strix" which means witch possibly due to
this association.

Halloween opens the door to the occult and Satan. Do not think you
can celebrate Halloween without consequences. It is not harmless. Satan
and his devils keep an eye on who really loves his day so he might pull
them more under his control and for Christians to pull you away from God.
God warned against witchcraft and Christians are to avoid it. Those who
participate in Halloween have made a covenant with death and agreement
with hell. Satan applauds you. (Isaiah 28:15 Because ye have said, We have
made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the
overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we
have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:)
Witches in witchcraft whether under the guise of Wicca, Satanism,
Freemasonry, or some other occult all believe Halloween is serious and
believe devils are unleashed on this night. It is on this night that they
cast their greatest spells. Witches often trample crosses on this night
and slander and curse saints and blasphemy Jesus. This is also the biggest
night for recruiting for Satanists. There is a spiritual war going on out
there whether people believe it or not. (Ephesians 6:12-13 For we wrestle
not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
wickedness in high places.
13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to
withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.) Satanists
believe people who profess to be atheists are bigger fools than Christians
as Christians at least recognize the spirit world whereas atheists deny
any God and the spirit world. Halloween celebrates the very things God
calls abominations, so why would a Christian want to be a part of such a
day? For the unsaved that may be listening Jesus can save you from Satan
and the occult. (Acts 26:18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may
receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are
sanctified by faith that is in me.) Jesus wants to save you from the
darkness of Satan and bring you to the light of Jesus. Call upon Jesus
today to save you and bring you out of darkness into light and from
Satan's kingdom to the kingdom of God. If a Satanist is listening the
blood of Jesus is powerful enough to wash away your sins and even save
you. For Christians, stop celebrating Halloween except to give the gospel
to children and adults. Tell them how they are sinners who need to be
saved and that Jesus died for their sins, was buried and rose again on the
third day so that they might have everlasting life. Christians do not be a
part of Satan's world and help support and promote his most holy day.
