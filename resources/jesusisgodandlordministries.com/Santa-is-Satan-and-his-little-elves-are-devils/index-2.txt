Santa is Satan and his little elves are devils

Santa Claus is depicted as a jolly fat old man with a long white
beard and wearing a red hat and a red suit with white trim and a black
belt. He usually wears glasses. He is said to deliver toys to children all
over the world on Christmas Eve in a sleigh flown by eight or nine
reindeer if Rudolph goes. Many children believe in his existence. He
supposedly enters the house through the chimney. His elves make his toys
where he lives at the North Pole.

Santa is none other than Satan. Santa Claus has a long connection to
Satan. The very name Santa is close to Satan. If you move the "n" in Santa
to the end you have Satan. Notice the serpent ("S") is in the very name of
both Satan and Santa. Halloween is the holiest day for Satanists, but
Christmas is also one of the most holy days for Satanists and requires a
sacrifice just like Halloween. Satan gets many people to commit suicide
around Christmas and with Santa he keeps children from Jesus. Satan always
tries to imitate things for God as well as mock the things of God.
Christmas started out as a pagan holiday, but became known as the day we
celebrated Jesus' birth in Bethlehem. Satan hated that one of his holidays
had been changed to celebrate Jesus and he had to take it back, thus the
birth of Santa Claus. Christmas is now most often thought of as Santa
Claus and not Jesus. Halloween is the day that many unsuspecting children
are drawn to the occult as they dress up along with Satanists. Satan
appears as his true self on Halloween. Christmas is the day that Satan
uses for his dress up and his costume is Santa Claus. This is another time
that children are used as the victims. I already mentioned how the name
Santa comes from Satan by moving the "n". Santa is saint in Spanish. Satan
also wants people to believe he is holy and a saint when he is vile and an
adversary of God. Satan wants to mock the true saints of God. Satan is
anything but holy. Claus means hoof-claws in Old English. Reindeer have
hooves and take the place of goats. The goat is the symbol often used for
Satan and is seen in the Freemasonry god Baphomet. Freemasons are satanic
as Freemasonry is Satanism in disguise. Santa dresses up in a red suit,
devil red. This is for two purposes. It is to mock the blood of Jesus that
was shed for everyone so that they might be saved if they called upon
Jesus and it also represents the much bloodshed by Satan and his helpers.
A small amount of white is seen on Santa and the elves to steal the purity
of God. Satan will never bring happiness. Santa goes around yelling Ho Ho
Ho. One person pointed out which just might be possible that the letter
"H" is the only letter with five equal lines which when moved just like
the letter "n" in Santa and combined with the "O" make an upside down
pentagram which is a symbol of Satan. Ho is also the word used by rappers
for whores. Something to think about. Some New Agers worship Sanat Kumara.
Sanat is Satan and this is seen by just switching the "t" and "n" in
Satan. This name is also similar to Santa which switches the last two
letters in Santa. Santa is known by many names just as Satan is.

Over the years many drunken homeless pedophiles have used Christmas
for their pleasure. Christmas is a pedophile's dream. They get to suit up
in a Santa suit and have endless children sit on their laps while the
children play with their beards and whisper in their ears. Many mall
Santa's or elsewhere have put sinful thoughts into children's ears as they
deceive the children and many have been drunk or made lewd remarks as
well. Christian parents bring their children to see Santa Claus and get
their pictures with him. Parents and children just trust anyone wearing a
Santa suit as a good guy. It is a shame how spiritually blind most
Christians are. When the children ask Santa for a toy they are really
praying to Satan and asking Satan and making a deal with him. Children
pray to Santa at bedtime and are in reality once again praying to Satan
instead of the true God Jehovah. Children pray to Santa just as parents
pray to God trusting that Santa will fulfill their wishes. Parents do not
realize that Satan wants children to have lots of toys and other items to
keep them distracted from Jesus and to learn to covet which violates the
tenth commandment. Santa is the god of materialism. Parents will go in
debt to buy their children presents. Such foolishness. (Exodus 20:17 Thou
shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy
neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor
his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.) Parents are teaching
their children the wrong message. When parents go along with the lie of
Santa and encourage their children to believe in Santa they are deceiving
them and setting them up on a path of destruction. God said do not harm
the little children. (Luke 17:2 It were better for him that a millstone
were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should
offend one of these little ones.) The parents are also sinning by lying to
their children and teaching them that lying is ok. God made lying the
ninth commandment and he hates liars. (Exodus 20:16 Thou shalt not bear
false witness against thy neighbour.) God said all liars will end up in
the lake of fire unless they repent and get saved. (Revelation 21:8 But
the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and
whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have
their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the
second death.) (Colossians 3:9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have
put off the old man with his deeds;) Parents do not go along teaching your
children about Santa just because everyone else does. (Proverbs 14:5 A
faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.) When
children get older and no longer believe in Santa Claus, they will not be
forgotten by Satan. Many children will not believe in Jesus when their
parents tell them about him as they will say that Jesus is just a fairy
tale just like Santa Claus was or the tooth fairy or the Easter bunny and
you are lying to us about Jesus as well and Satan for that matter as well.
Satan will have won. Satan will now pull the children away from God and
closer to him. Santa Claus encourages obesity in children. Parents are not
to offend children which they do by lying to them about Santa Claus.

There are towns named after Santa such as Santa Claus, Indiana as
well as theme parks such as Santa's Village in Jefferson, New Hampshire
and other things dedicated to Santa Claus. Santa Claus is at the end of
the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. Thanksgiving a holiday meant to celebrate
us being thankful for what God has given us is then turned over to Satan
as Santa for the next month to turn children away from celebrating the
birth of Jesus at Christmas and to focus on Santa. Children are encouraged
to write to Santa and the post office goes along. Christians including
Baptists see nothing wrong in visiting these places, dressing up as Santa
Claus, or being part of plays about Santa, or worse having a Santa play in
church. Christians are bringing Satan right into their churches and they
are so blind they cannot even see this. Christians including Baptists will
put Santa decorations around the house and church. Christians will take
their children to see Santa and will let them dress up as elves. Christian
parents tell their children Santa brought their presents. Why give the
glory to Satan. God gave the money to parents and other people to be able
to buy the gifts, not Satan. Why would parents or individuals who work
hard all year long want Santa to get credit for what they bought? Children
need to learn to realize that money does not grow on trees and that no
matter how good they may have been they cannot have all of the gifts they
want. Santa is not real and will not bring them to them. Family members
give them their gifts. People spend more money to celebrate Christmas than
for any other holiday by far. Much of this is Santa related or at least
secular that denies Jesus. Christian parents teaching the lie of Santa can
make themselves and their children lose faith in God when he does not
answer their prayers the way Santa does. Christians who buy gifts for
people should spend at least the same amount on Jesus. After all it is
supposedly his birthday, not ours. Christians should spend at least the
same amount of money and preferably more for Jesus by giving to
missionaries, good Christian ministries, buying tracts to issue to people
while shopping, or in other ways that will win souls for Jesus and bless
Jesus not Satan the way Santa does. Christians who point out the evil of
Santa Claus are ridiculed by other Christians, let alone the unsaved. This
shows the state of Christians in the world today when they will defend
Satan over Jesus.

Many cities in America and around the world will not let a nativity
scene with its baby Jesus be in the town square or elsewhere, yet Santa
Claus is allowed all over the city. Some cities have even had Satanism
displays and many places that do have nativity displays have had the Jesus
figure stolen or desecrated showing how much Satan has control of
Christmas. People do not even see the irony in this as it is supposed to
be Jesus' birthday, but it is made into Satan's day. Most religious
Christmas cards have been done away with and replaced with ones dealing
with Santa Claus and things related to him. Even most Christians have no
problem sending Santa cards. Christmas postage stamps are normally always
secular in nature with maybe one religious stamp which is usually a
depiction of a Roman Catholic Jesus and Madonna (Mary) instead of a
Biblical Jesus, so even the religious stamp eliminates Jesus. Madonna is
Italian for "my lady". Roman Catholics refer to Mary as "Our Lady" since
they believe she is the Queen of Heaven. Lady is the female equivalent of
Lord as Roman Catholics try to make Mary equal with Jesus. People are no
longer supposed to say Merry Christmas, but Happy Holidays or Seasons
Greetings instead just so long as Christ is not mentioned. Holiday means
holy day. When Christmas is used it is often written as Xmas in order to
cross out or stamp out Christ once again. Christmas is one of the most
holy days for Satanists who are required to make a sacrifice to Satan,
either a person or an animal, preferably a person.  

Santa possesses attributes and things that belong to God. Santa Claus
is said to live at the North Pole. It is believed heaven is located in the
north and heaven is where God is. The empty space is where heaven is
believed to be. (Job 26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty
place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.) (Psalm 48:2 Beautiful for
situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the
north, the city of the great King.) Satan has always wanted to be the god
of heaven. (Isaiah 14:13-14 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will
ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will
sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most
High.) Santa is said to be able to deliver toys to every child in the
world on Christmas Eve. He is able to be at different malls and other
locations around the world all at the same time. It is said to be really
Santa, not a man in a red suit. Santa can travel very quickly. These
abilities give Santa omnipresence or the ability to be everywhere at the
same time. This attribute belongs to God only. Santa supposedly knows if a
child has been bad or good and knows what the child wants for Christmas
before they tell him. This makes Santa omniscient or all knowing. This
attribute again only belongs to God. Santa can supposedly squeeze his fat
body down a skinny chimney with his bag of toys and then is able to make
the toys normal size again and himself without any damage and all at the
blink of an eye. He even can come down a chimney with a fire in it and not
get burnt or even smell of smoke. For Santa to do this he would have to be
omnipotent or all powerful. He would have to be able to recreate toys and
other items. Once again only God is omnipotent. (Revelation 19:6 And I
heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many
waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the
Lord God omnipotent reigneth.) Satan as an angel can go through walls
which is essentially what Santa does. Santa reigns as king at the North
Pole just as Jesus is King, yet Jesus is King of kings. Satan is also the
ruler or prince of this world. (I Timothy 6:15 Which in his times he shall
shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord
of lords;) (John 14:30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the
prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.) Satan tries to steal
all of the attributes of God and use them under the guise of Santa. Santa
is said to ride around heaven in a sleigh pulled by eight reindeer or nine
with Rudolph. God rides around heaven in a chariot of which the sleigh
represents. (Deuteronomy 33:26 ¶ There is none like unto the God of
Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on
the sky.) (Psalm 104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters:
who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the
wind:) Satan as a cherub has wings which the sleigh also represents.
(Ezekiel 28:14 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set
thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and
down in the midst of the stones of fire.) Santa always travels at night
just as Satan loves the night and can see in the dark just like Satan.
Rudolph who leads the sleigh has a red shining nose that can see through
the fog. This tries to steal from Jesus who is the light of the world.
(John 8:12 ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of
the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
the light of life.) Getting children used to the idea of Santa flying
around in the heaven prepares children for the sighting of satanic UFO's.
Just as God gives spiritual gifts to Christians who are his children,
Santa brings gifts to his children. Santa brings toys to the good children
and coal or nothing to the bad children just as God will reward Christians
with crowns on judgment day and the unsaved will be cast into hell with
its burning brimstone or sulfur. God gave the gift of his Son Jesus Christ
who gives everlasting life to those who receive this free gift, whereas
Santa as Satan brings the gift of everlasting death. Santa never ages or
dies and seems to have no beginning. He is basically immortal just as God
is and has always existed. Santa wears red clothing as does Jesus.
(Revelation 19:13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and
his name is called The Word of God.) Santa has white hair and so do Jesus
and God. Santa is a jolly old man and God is the Ancient of days. There is
nothing jolly about Satan. (Daniel 7:9 ¶ I beheld till the thrones were
cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as
snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the
fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.) (Revelation 1:14 His head
and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as
a flame of fire;) Santa is always said to be coming soon at Christmas time
just as Jesus is coming soon. (James 5:8 Be ye also patient; stablish your
hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.) Santa has elves to help
him just as Jesus has angels to assist him. Santa gives gifts to people
just as Jesus gave the gift of himself on the cross for men. (Ephesians
4:7-8 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of
the gift of Christ.
8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
captive, and gave gifts unto men.) Santa wears glasses like the wise old
owl that supposedly represents wisdom. Owls are connected to Satan. Wisdom
comes from God, not Satan. Santa Claus is also known as Father Christmas a
steal from Father God or God the Father and also Kris Kringle which steals
from Jesus Christ. Kris Kringle comes from the German word Christkindl
which means Christ child. It is clear that they are equating Santa with
Jesus.

Santa Claus can be traced back to St. Nicholas and Father Time. St.
Nicholas was a Roman Catholic bishop that supposedly performed many
miracles and lived in the 300's. In reality he traces back to the
Saturnian festival held in December that was very heathen in nature. He is
celebrated by Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics and other denominations
that worship saints. Ole Nick is said to be the name of a fallen angel or
the devil. Father Christmas is of English origin back to the 1500's.
Modern Santa Claus comes from the United States in the early 1800's.  

Santa has many elves to help him. They make the toys in Santa's
workshop and do other things to assist him. They are extremely loyal to
Santa. These represent Satan's helpers, the devils who are extremely loyal
to Satan. Elves have long been associated with Satan and were said to be
very wicked, so why are Santa's elves thought so fondly of? They perform
magic which God condemns. They dress in green as a mockery to Jesus. Jesus
brings life, yet devils represented here as elves bring death. The color
green means life and Santa's elves are making a mockery of Jesus by saying
true life is Satan. Just as Santa's red mocks the blood of Jesus, the
elves green mocks the everlasting life Jesus brings. They wear red under
the green in honor of their master Santa (Satan). Elves can be traced back
throughout European history especially in Germany, Iceland, England, and
Scotland. They were always considered evil beings and were associated with
Satan. They were thought of as devils. Just as devils present themselves
as aliens today, they previously presented themselves as elves and then
later fairies. Elves are depicted with pointy ears representative of the
horns of Baphomet which represents Satan along with pointy hats and shoes.
Baphomet is depicted as a goat with wings. Satan is a cherub which have
wings. Male elves referred to as incubi were said to rape sleeping women.
This goes along with what happened in Genesis 6. In Norse mythology elves
were known as "hidden folks". I said elves help Santa with gifts. Prior to
elves becoming common in Sweden, the Yule goat helped Santa hand out
gifts. I already mentioned how the goat is associated with Satan. Elves
are depicted as dwarfs. Dwarfs were also associated with Satan throughout
history as devils. Elves were always thought of as satanic until modern
times. They are now associated as innocent helpers of Santa Claus. Satan
is great at deception. Santa Claus was described as a plump jolly old elf
in the story Twas the Night Before Christmas originally titled A Visit
from St. Nicholas. This again supports Satan who is the devil just as
elves are devils. Santa Claus is called the Christmas Goat in Finland
again showing the connection to Satan.

Christians get rid of all things to do with Santa Claus and do not
allow your children to have anything to do with him either, whether on
television, books, movies, or anything else. Get Satan out of your house
and your lives and repent of your sins. Remember Santa (Satan) did not
come to earth to be born as the God-man to die for our sins, only the Lord
Jesus Christ did. Satan only wants to destroy your life and the lives of
your children. Santa Claus is a counterfeit god who is nothing more than
Satan. Turn away from Santa and to Jesus today. Make Christmas about
Jesus, not Santa and his evil elves. For the unsaved get saved today and
celebrate Jesus instead of Santa Claus at Christmas and get real life with
Jesus.
