Was Jesus Crucified on Friday?

Was Jesus crucified on Friday or another day of the week. We have
always been taught that Jesus was crucified on what has become to be known
as Good Friday, but is that correct. Many people just repeat what they are
taught without searching the scriptures themselves.

Some people say Jesus was crucified on Wednesday or Thursday. I
believe the scriptures indicate Thursday was the correct day. Just about
everyone agrees that Jesus rose from the grave on Sunday, today referred
to as Resurrection Day or Easter. (Mark 16:9 ¶ Now when Jesus was risen
early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out
of whom he had cast seven devils.) Many other verses tell of the women and
later Peter and John going to the tomb of Jesus on the first day of the
week. We know the first day of the week is Sunday as the Jews sabbath day
was Saturday which was the last day of the week.

(Matthew 12:40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart
of the earth.)

Jesus said he would be in the heart of the earth for three days and
three nights. The Jews counted any part of a day as a full day, even if it
was only an hour. Unlike our day and the Romans day which starts at
midnight, the Jews day started at sunset or 6 pm. Even with the thinking
of a partial day, you cannot get three days and three nights from Friday
to Sunday morning. You would have Friday day, Friday night, Saturday day,
Saturday night, and Sunday day for three days, but only two nights.
Scripture tells us Jesus gave up the ghost at the ninth hour or 3 PM.
(Mark 15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?) (Mark 15:37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice,
and gave up the ghost.)

Jesus was our passover lamb. (I Corinthians 5:7 Purge out therefore
the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even
Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:) 

We know they sacrificed the Passover lamb on 14 Nissan. (II Chronicles
35:1 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they
killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.) The first
month on the Jewish religious calendar is Nissan.

If Jesus rose again three days later, that would be 17 Nissan. If 17
Nissan was a Sunday, then 14 Nissan was a Thursday. The Jews actually
sacrificed the passover lamb on preparation day (John 19:14-15 14 And it
was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he
saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! 15 But they cried out, Away with
him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify
your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.), the
same day the house was cleansed of all leaven (leaven represents sin). The
actual passover was on 14 Nissan, with 15 Nisan being the first day of the
feast of unleavened bread, and we know Saturday or 16 Nissan was the
regular weekly sabbath. (Leviticus 23:5-8 In the fourteenth day of the
first month at even is the LORD'S passover.
6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened
bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no
servile work therein.
8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in
the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile
work therein.) Jesus presented himself as an offering for the feast of
unleavened bread. The chief priests wanted to remove Jesus from the cross
as quickly as possible and bury him since a high holy sabbath day was
coming with passover at sunset and the weekly sabbath following after it.
(John 19:31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the
bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that
sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be
broken, and that they might be taken away. The regular weekly sabbath was
never referred to as a high day, only feast days. No work was to be done
on these days. This is why the women waited until Sunday to bring the
spices for Jesus's body since they  could not do anything on the sabbath
days. So if you have two days in between his death and his resurrection on
Sunday, it makes Thursday his day of crucifixion.

(John 12:1 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany,
where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.)

Jesus was at the home of Lazarus on 9 Nissan, just before he entered
Jerusalem on what we call Palm Sunday on 10 Nissan. Adding 6 days to 9
Nissan gives us 15 Nissan for the passover, which was on Friday. Mary
anointed the feet of Jesus (John 12:3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment
of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his
feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the
ointment.) to prepare Jesus for his upcoming death.

(Mark 15:25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.)

We know Jesus went to the cross at the third hour (9 am) and gave up the
ghost at the ninth hour (3 pm). 9 am was the time the Jews brought their
passover lamb to the temple to wait for it to be slaughtered and
sacrificed at 3 pm. Jesus as our passover  lamb also went to the cross at
9 am and was dead at 3 pm. His blood dripped onto the mercy seat of the
ark of the covenant hidden under the cross found by Ron Wyatt a nurse and
amateur archaeologist. The high priest used to place the blood of the sin
offering on the mercy seat (Leviticus 16:15 ¶ Then shall he kill the goat
of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within
the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock,
and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:). Jesus as
our High Priest (Hebrews 3:1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the
heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession,
Christ Jesus;) who was the ultimate sin offering to cover all sins for all
mankind forever later placed his blood on the heavenly mercy seat, but
only after leaving his blood on the earthly mercy seat in accordance with
the law. (Hebrews 9:11-13 11 But Christ being come an high priest of good
things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with
hands, that is to say, not of this building;
12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he
entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption
for us.
13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:) This
was why Jesus told Mary Magdalene on that Sunday morning of his
resurrection, not to touch him, since he had not ascended to his Father
yet. Jesus had not placed his blood on the heavenly mercy seat yet and
could not allow Mary Magdalene to touch him before he did or he would be
polluted from her sin and could not have been our sinless and clean
sacrifice. Ron Wyatt had the blood of Jesus tested by Jewish experts not
telling them were it came from and they confirmed it had 24 chromosomes
instead of the normal 46 chromosomes. Jesus received 23 from Mary and one
Y chromosome from the Holy Ghost. 24 is the number for the priesthood as
seen in the 24 courses of the priests. Jesus is our high priest. Many of
the Jewish experts were later saved when they were told that blood was
from their Jewish Messiah. Jesus blood had water added to it and was made
alive again showing Jesus's blood never died. Normal blood cannot be
tested for DNA once dried out.

Jesus rose on 17 Nissan which was also the feast of the first fruits.
Jesus was the first fruits of resurrection. (I Corinthians 15:20 But now
is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that
slept.) (I Corinthians 15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the
firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.) The number
17 means victory (and also possibly security in the Lord) which all have
if they choose Jesus as their Saviour and Jesus had victory over Satan and
death with his resurrection. The feast of first fruits always was on the
first day after the regular sabbath following passover which would have
been Sunday when Jesus rose from the grave. (Leviticus 23:10-11 Speak unto
the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land
which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall
bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:
11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on
the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.) Fifty days from
the feast of first fruits was Pentecost, also known as the feast of weeks.
This was when the Holy Ghost was given.  

When Jesus entered Jerusalem on 10 Nissan or Palm Sunday, that was
also the day the Jews selected their lamb to be killed for the passover.
Jesus was presenting himself to the Jews as their passover lamb. 10 means
law and Jesus obeyed and fulfilled all of the law to the letter. Jesus
entered Jerusalem on Palm Sunday on the exact day as Daniel had predicted
over 500 years earlier, so the Jews were without excuse for not realizing
that Jesus was their Messiah. Jesus would be cut off or crucified on the
day scripture says. Sixty nine weeks of seven years, with each week
representing seven years equals 483 years since the Persian king Cyrus
allowed the people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild. (Daniel 9:25-26
Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the
commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the
Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street
shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not
for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy
the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and
unto the end of the war desolations are determined.) The last week of
seven years is yet to come in the future tribulation.

Jesus died at 33. The number 33 means promise. If one has received
Jesus as their personal Saviour and is saved, they have the promise of
eternal life with Jesus.

The word blood is found 447 times in scripture and sin is found 448
times. The blood of Jesus covers all sin except the sin of the blasphemy
of the Holy Ghost. (Matthew 12:31-32 31 ¶ Wherefore I say unto you, All
manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy
against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.
32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be
forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not
be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.)

Jesus died on the 14^th. 14 means deliverance. Jesus was delivered to
the cross for our salvation. The number 15 means rest as the 15^th was the
passover and we can rest knowing that Jesus died for our sins and will
save us if we call upon Jesus to save us.

As a side note, the Easter bunny and Easter eggs are both of heathen
origin, most likely from Germany or the area around Northern Europe. The
bunny and eggs are representative of the ancient fertility goddess as
Satan has always been about sex and tries to bring it into all aspects of
a Christian's life. The bunny was chosen as she gives birth to lots of
rabbits in the Spring around the time of Easter. The bunny is a very
reproductive animal and the saying of someone with lots of children is she
breeds like a rabbit. The coloring of the eggs was in honour of the
heathen goddess. The Roman Catholic Church says the eggs represent the
emergence of Jesus from the tomb and the resurrection of Jesus. Leave it
to a cult to support a heathen tradition. Do not believe any of these
lies. The Easter bunny and Easter eggs have nothing to do with Jesus or
his resurrection and are only put there by Satan to support a heathen
goddess and to corrupt the most holiest day for Christians, the
resurrection of Jesus. Satan wants people to not think about Jesus, but
rather a bunny and painting eggs and having an Easter egg hunt with gifts
inside such as toys or candy. Why are Christian holidays always about the
children and not about Jesus? No Christian should participate in any
Easter egg hunts or allow their children to and they should have nothing
to do with egg painting or the Easter bunny. Do not bring your children to
see the Easter bunny and get a picture with him. Just as Satan has taken
over Christmas with Santa, he has taken over Easter or Resurrection Day
with the Easter bunny and painted eggs. Many churches even have Easter egg
hunts though they try to justify it by saying they are Resurrection Day
eggs or some other name and they say they have Bible verses inside them.
Easter has become commercialized just like Christmas and the focus is
placed on a bunny and eggs rather than Jesus. These churches do not help
the situation. Tell the pastors of these churches to stop this nonsense.
Christians stay away from both and lets return the day back to Jesus and
his glorious resurrection. Easter is not about a bunny and eggs, it is
about Jesus and his resurrection which without that we would still be dead
in our sins, so let us put Jesus back in Easter.

For those who may be listening and are not saved, today is the day to
call upon Jesus as your Saviour so that you too can celebrate the
resurrection of Jesus and not the Easter bunny. Turn from your sin and
pray and ask Jesus to save you. Do it now.
