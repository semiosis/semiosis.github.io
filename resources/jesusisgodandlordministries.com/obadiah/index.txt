Obadiah

Obadiah is the 31^st book of the old testament and the Holy Bible and
is located between Amos and Jonah. Obadiah is considered one of the twelve
minor prophets. Obadiah is the shortest book in the old testament. Obadiah
consists of only one chapter of twenty one verses. The number 21 means
exceeding sinfulness of sin of which Edom had much sin. This book is about
the coming destruction of Edom. The Edomites were descendants of Esau who
was the twin brother of Jacob. Edom means red. (Genesis 25:30 And Esau
said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am
faint: therefore was his name called Edom.) (Genesis 36:1 Now these are
the generations of Esau, who is Edom.) The Edomites had always been
enemies of God and just as we saw how God destroyed the Assyrians in our
study on Nahum, God promises to do the same to the Edomites. Just because
the Edomites are related to the Israelites does not give them a free pass
from God's wrath. God is no respecter of persons and no one is exempt from
his wrath for persecuting his chosen people the Israelites. (Acts 10:34 ¶
Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is
no respecter of persons:) God said he hated Esau. (Malachi 1:2-3 2 I have
loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not
Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,
3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the
dragons of the wilderness.) We see in verse three how God laid Edom waste
just as God predicted by his prophet Obadiah. (Romans 9:13 As it is
written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.) Judgment against Edom
is mentioned probably more in the old testament than against any other
nation. The nation of Edom is no longer around today and became just one
of many nations that have come and gone over the years. Most of the land
where Edom was located is now a part of Israel and Jordan. It is believed
that Obadiah wrote this prophecy against Edom in 585 BC the year after
Jerusalem was captured by the Babylonians. This would make Obadiah a
prophet at the same time as Jeremiah. Just as God destroyed Edom an enemy
of Israel, God will also one day destroy the enemies of Christians. Just
as Jonah and Nahum dealt with a heathen nation rather than Israel or
Judah, so does Obadiah. It seems that the Obadiah that wrote this book was
one of possibly thirteen different Obadiah's mentioned in scripture. It
seems the name Obadiah means a worshipper or servant of Jehovah.

(Obadiah 1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning
Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent
among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.) We
see in this verse how God gave a vision to Obadiah. This vision was only
for him. God sends a rumor to the heathen nations. The heathen nations
hear this rumor and realize that God has sent an ambassador to speak of
the coming destruction of Edom by these heathen nations. History seems to
show that the Edomites were destroyed as a nation shortly after this
prophecy was given by Obadiah by the Babylonians though she still survived
until at least 125 BC and some say until they were defeated by the
Muslims. This means multiple nations were involved in her final
destruction just as God said.  

(Obadiah 2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
greatly despised.) Edom was a fairly powerful nation at the time of the
prophecy against her and a nation that thought she was able to withstand
attack against her just as Tyre had thought, but God said he would make
Edom small among the heathen as she would be no more. Edom was involved in
much trade with other nations.

(Obadiah 3 ¶ The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that
dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith
in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?) It was Edom's pride
that had deceived her as she thought she was invincible not only due to
her physical location but also as a relative of the Israelites. She said
who can bring me down. It is believed that her capital called Bozrah in
scripture is the same place as the Greek name for it known as Petra. It is
believed that at one time Petra was a part of Edom and if this is true
this may be what is referred to here by God in the phrase "dwellest in the
clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high". Petra was cut out of red
rocks just like Edom's namesake of being red. There is only one narrow
entrance into this city with the rock walls standing about 200 feet tall.
This is why Edom thought she was invincible. It is believed by many
theologians that Petra will be the place that the Israelites will escape
to during the great tribulation and be supernaturally protected by God.  

(Obadiah 4 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou
set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the
LORD.) Edom exalted herself just like an eagle and just like an eagle that
has her nest high in the tops of trees, Edom had her capital surrounded by
high rock walls, but God said that would not stop God from bringing her
down. This passage also seems to be a subtle slam against Satan that he
too will be brought down though he tried to exalt himself above the stars
of God (angels) as he wanted to be God.

(Obadiah 5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art
thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the
grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?) This verse
shows how Edom would one day be destroyed with nothing left to take as she
would be "cut off". Normally thieves take the valuable things and leave
the rest behind just as grapegatherers would leave the rotten grapes
behind, but God will have the nations take everything that belongs to Edom
leaving nothing behind. Today much of this former area is still desolate
with not much there.

(Obadiah 6 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his
hidden things sought up!) These thieves will search out all of what Edom
has. Nothing will remain hidden from them. Edom as a nation involved in
much trade, probably had many great treasures stored in Petra believing
they were safe and well hidden from invaders, but God allows the invaders
to capture even the hidden things. Nothing is hid from God and he then
tells the invaders were to go.

(Obadiah 7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to
the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and
prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under
thee: there is none understanding in him.) The first part of the verse
seems to speak of the allies of Edom that turn against her as they have
deceived her as well as others that were at peace with her and traded with
her. Jeremiah most like speaks of these confederate nations with Edom in
the nations of Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon. (Jeremiah 27:3 And send them
to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the
Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand
of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;)
These nations refused to help Edom in her time of need only worrying about
themselves. Nations that have eaten of her food have hurt her as they
refuse to come to her aid. The last phrase of the verse in not having any
understanding seems to leave Edom wondering why no one will help her and
what was she supposed to do as she had no one to turn to.

(Obadiah 8 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the
wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?) Often
it is the wise men that think they do not need God. God will destroy all
of the wise men out of Edom. Without leaders and intellect the nation will
be doomed. God applies this same principle to all of those who think they
are so wise that they do not need God.

(Obadiah 9 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end
that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.) Teman
was a city about fifteen miles south of the capital Petra (Bozrah).
Eliphaz who was one of Job's friends was a Temanite. God says he would
destroy Teman as well just like he would destroy the capital of Bozrah.
Many mighty men lived in Teman, but they would be destroyed by being
slaughtered. Amos said God would send fire to destroy both Teman and
Bozrah. (Amos 1:12 But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour
the palaces of Bozrah.) This will leave Teman desolate. (Jeremiah 49:20
Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom;
and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman:
Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make
their habitations desolate with them.)

(Obadiah 10 ¶ For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall
cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.) Because Esau the founder
of Edom and his descendants had brought violence against Jacob and his
descendants the Israelites then God would bring shame to the nation as the
whole world will see of her destruction as she is cut off from the world
forever. She suffered for a while until God cut her off from even being a
nation anymore and today there are no Edomites.  

(Obadiah 11 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the
day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners
entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as
one of them.) This verse is speaking of the day that Babylon captured
Jerusalem how many people of Judah tried to escape to neighboring Edom,
but Edom helped the Babylonians capture them instead of helping a nation
related to them. History says the Babylonians allowed the Edomites to take
some of the spoils of Jerusalem for helping them. Who needs enemies when
your family is against you? God includes the Edomites as foreigners and
strangers even though they are related to the Israelites.

(Obadiah 12 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy
brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have
rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction;
neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.) God
condemns the Edomites for having rejoiced at the destruction of Jerusalem
and the nation of Judah as she was taken captive by the Babylonians. Edom
spoke this with pride in acting like Edom was so much better than Judah as
if this would never happen to them. God warns us against rejoicing when
our enemy is destroyed. We should not rejoice that people go to hell. We
see in this verse how Edom thought of Judah as a stranger. This goes back
to Esau and Jacob as Jacob fled from Esau for twenty years.

(Obadiah 13 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my
people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked
on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on
their substance in the day of their calamity;) This verse again speaks of
how Edom entered Jerusalem after her fall and how the Edomites
participated with the Babylonians in the spoils of Jerusalem. It also
shows again how Edom gloated over the destruction of Jerusalem and of
Judah. God stresses this fact that they did this three times and lets you
know it is Judah being spoken of here with the phrase "in the day of their
calamity".

(Obadiah 14 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut
off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up
those of his that did remain in the day of distress.) This verse speaks of
what I previously said how Edom prevented those fleeing from Judah to
escape to Edom, but rather turned them over to the Babylonians. God may
have been punishing Judah, but that does not justify Edom also punishing
the people of Judah. Vengeance belongs to God, not Edom and God did not
need any help from Edom. We see in this verse how God will punish his
chosen people, but how he also stills loves them enough that he will not
tolerate anyone else trying to harm them above what he allows for their
punishment.

(Obadiah 15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as
thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon
thine own head.) God says the day of his coming judgment of the nations
will be coming soon. This day will happen at the end of the great
tribulation during the period of days just before the start of the
millennium. (See Matthew 25:31-46) All of those nations who were the
enemies of Israel will get their just reward from God and be destroyed
permanently. God will bring upon them what they sowed upon Israel. God
said we reap what we sow and Edom and the other heathen nations will soon
reap for sowing hatred against Israel. Edom has a long history of being
against Israel such as the time Edom refused to let Israel pass through
their land when they were wondering in the wilderness. (Numbers 20:21 Thus
Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel
turned away from him.)   

(Obadiah 16 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all
the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall
swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.) This verse
may speak of how when the Edomites entered Jerusalem to partake of the
spoils, she was not only drunk with glee at Judah's destruction, but was
literally drunk with alcohol upon God's holy mountain. Jerusalem is God's
holy city and sits upon a mountain. God says Edom and all of the heathen
nations will drink of his coming wrath against the nations.

(Obadiah 17 ¶ But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there
shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their
possessions.) This verse through the end of the book deals with the
millennium. During the millennium Israel will finally have all of the land
that God promised her. This land includes all of what at one time was the
nation of Edom who would no longer exist just as she does not today. She
may have gloated over Judah's capture, but this was only temporary as God
sent Judah back to her land after 70 years yet Edom would one day
disappear with Israel controlling her former land. I previously mentioned
how parts of former Edom are already part of Israel. Holiness will one day
come to the former land of Edom.

(Obadiah 18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of
Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle
in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the
house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.) This verse seems to speak of
the one day unification of Israel and Judah again during the millennium
and how Edom (the house of Esau) will not be around. The house of Jacob is
Judah and the house of Joseph is Israel or Ephraim as it was sometimes
referred to as. Ephraim was the youngest son of Joseph. Israel will act
like a fire against the stubble of Edom. Just as stubble which is the left
over cut stalks of grain sticking out of the ground will burn very easily
and be consumed, Edom will also be consumed by the fire of a united
Israel. God not only destroyed the nation of Edom, but all of her people
so that today there are no Edomite people alive anywhere.

(Obadiah 19 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau;
and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields
of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.)
This verse speaks of how Israel will control all of the land as promised
to her during the millennium including of her former enemies of Edom and
Philistia. She will also control the former land of Judah and Israel.
Israel will control the mountains, fields, and the plains. They will
control it all. Israel will be the most powerful nation during the
millennium.

(Obadiah 20 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel
shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the
captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of
the south.) Verse 20 continues by showing how the Israelites (children of
Israel) that had been held captive (by Assyria) will one day control the
land of her former enemy the Canaanites and how Judah (captivity of
Jerusalem) will control the cities of the south. This verse shows how one
day all Jews from all over the world wherever they were scattered will one
day return to the Promised Land. This is partially happening now.

(Obadiah 21 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the
mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S.) This verse ends with
the prophecy that Jesus will return to reign during the millennium with
his saints and that judgment has been made against Edom and how the
millennial kingdom belongs to the LORD. He will rule with a rod of iron
and no competition will be allowed against him. The phrase "the kingdom
shall be the LORD's" also shows how the land of Edom will belong to God
who has taken it from Edom and given the land to Israel. Mount Zion spoken
of here refers to Jerusalem where Jesus will rule and reign from. The
phrase "to judge the mount of Esau" refers again to the fact that God will
not allow Edom as a nation into the millennial kingdom or any Edomites
unless they were saved. God destroyed Edom just as he said he would by his
prophet Obadiah and he will also destroy all the enemies of Israel one
day. Let us pray for the United States that we will stay on the side of
God and not become his enemy by our attacks on Israel.
