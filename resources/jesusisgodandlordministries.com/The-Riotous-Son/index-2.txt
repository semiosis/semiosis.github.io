The Riotous Son

Most people who have any knowledge of the Holy Bible have heard the
story about the riotous son found in Luke 15:11-32. Most people call him
the prodigal son, but God calls him the riotous son. Prodigal means lavish
and wasteful spending. Many people do not realize that this story is a
perfect Father's Day story as the father here is a type of God the Father
who loves all people and wishes that none should perish. (II Peter 3:9 The
Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but
is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that
all should come to repentance.) God the Father will do what is necessary
to bring his wayward and wandering children back to him, even if it means
that they must be brought down low and almost to the bottom of the barrel
in order to wake them up. God does not do these things to be mean, but
rather out of love as he does not want anyone to spend eternity in the
lake of fire.  

Jesus gave this parable right after he told the parables about the 99
sheep and one that wondered off followed by a woman who had ten pieces of
silver and lost one. In both cases the shepherd and the woman do whatever
it takes to find the lost sheep and the lost piece of silver, even leaving
the 99 sheep that did not wander. They both rejoice at finding the lost
sheep and lost piece of silver. Jesus said that in heaven there is joy in
heaven more over one sinner that repents than over 99 persons who need no
repentance. These two parables set the tone for this third parable about
the riotous son. The whole point of this story is that God the Father
rejoices over those who repent and get right with him. This pleases God
more than those who need no repentance as the older son in this story as
he is already pleasing God.

(Luke 15:11-12 11 ¶ And he said, A certain man had two sons:
12 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion
of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.) The
parable starts off with a certain man who had two sons. This man or father
is a type or reference of God the Father. The two sons in this parable are
both representative of Christians with the older son being faithful to God
the Father and the younger son as a rebellious wandering backslidden milk
Christian. They both have to be saved or they would not be sons of God as
the unsaved are not God's children. We only become a child of God when we
are saved. (Galatians 3:26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in
Christ Jesus.) A person can become very backslidden as this younger son
became, but they do not lose their salvation, but always remain saved.
Their way of living may not please God, but they will remain saved. In
verse 12 we see that the younger son says to the father to give him his
portion of goods. This is not like how Jesus said that we were to pray to
God the Father and ask for our daily bread that we need to survive. This
son was demanding that he get his inheritance which is really a gift. An
inheritance is given to the children after the death of the father, yet
this son demanded it now. This son was basically saying he wished his
father was dead or at least he had no use for him and did not need him. He
figured as long as he had goods from the father then he could survive on
his own. He wanted the gifts from the father, but not the father in his
life. This is what happens to Christians who have backslidden and
especially as bad as this son as they feel that God owes them because they
are his son, yet they do not want God the Father in their lives and always
telling them how to live their lives. They want to stay living in sin and
do not want God the Father interfering. The end of the verse shows that
the father granted his sons wish and divided the inheritance between the
two sons. God will let you wander from him and live in sin for a while,
but there will be consequences for that rebellion and the riotous son was
about to find out.   

(Luke 15:13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all
together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
substance with riotous living.) Not long after the younger son was given
his portion of the inheritance then he gathered his goods together and
journeyed to a far country. The son was trying to get as far from his
father as he could so the father would not see how he was living.
Backsliding Christians do the same as they try to get as far from God as
they can, not realizing that God is everywhere and you cannot escape from
him. The only reason any Christian would want to is if they are living a
life of sin. This younger son soon wasted his substance on riotous living.
This is why I call him the riotous son as he was being more than
extravagant and lavish as prodigal means, he was being riotous in the way
he lived including his rebellion against his father. A person can be
lavish in buying many homes, a boat, an airplane, and fancy cars, but here
the son was spending the money on sinful things such as harlots. Notice
that the older son who represents a son or Christian that is walking with
God continued to stay with his father even though he was also given his
share of the inheritance early. Obedient Christians will always remain
close to God as it is only God who can keep you walking righteously and
can keep you safe.

(Luke 15:14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in
that land; and he began to be in want.) Not long after he had spent all of
his money, then there came a famine in the land and he was lacking or in
want of what he needed to survive. There is always a famine in lands that
reject God, both physical famine and famine of his word. God will always
bring famine into the lives of his wandering children so that he can make
them realize that they can only survive because of him as only God
supplies our needs. All that a Christian has comes from God and none
because of ourselves. (Philippians 4:19 But my God shall supply all your
need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.)

(Luke 15:15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that
country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.) The riotous son
was desperate for food and so he went to work for a man in his fields to
feed swine. For a Jewish man this was about as low as you could get as
swine were an unclean animal and a Jew was not to eat their flesh or even
touch a dead swine. Most likely this is what he would have to do as some
may have died in the fields. (Deuteronomy 14:8 And the swine, because it
divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye
shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.)

(Luke 15:16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks
that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.) The son was so hungry
that he would have fain filled his belly with the husks that the swine
ate. The word fain means gladly or with joy. The husks were the dry outer
covering that is discarded and not eaten by man, just the swine, yet he
was so hungry he would gladly have eaten even that. The end of the verse
says no man gave unto him. He was not given any food to eat, yet the swine
were fed. Here was a rich man who squandered his wealth on riotous living
and now the swine were fed better than him who had no feed. This is what
happens when Christians try to do things on their own and do not want God
in their lives. We also see how his "friends" he probably had while he was
rich have long forgotten him since his money ran out. Even they will not
give him any food. Scripture says everyone loves rich people and he would
have been no different as he probably foolishly spent great wealth on them
trying to impress them, but when the money is gone so are your "friends".
(Proverbs 14:20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich
hath many friends.)

(Luke 15:17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired
servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with
hunger!) The riotous son finally realizes what a fool he has been as he
realizes that his father has many hired servants who have plenty of food
to eat and some to spare and yet he was dying of hunger. The son has ended
his backsliding and is starting to repent of his sins. God took him to a
very low point in life in order to get him to repent. He brought the son
close to death in order to do so, but because he was his son never gave up
on him.

(Luke 15:18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,) The son has come
to repentance and says that he will go back to his father and tell him
that he has sinned against heaven and his father. The son realizes that he
has sinned against God. That is the sign of true repentance and then as
this son he wants to do something about it. God says if we confess our
sins before him then he will forgive them and this son realized his father
would as well. (I John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.)

(Luke 15:19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as
one of thy hired servants.) The son continues to show true repentance as
he feels he is not even worthy to be called a son of his father due to his
sins. He says he will tell his father to make him one of his hired
servants instead. The psalmist realized that it was better to be a servant
of God than to be in rebellion and sin as this son had been. (Psalm 84:10
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a
doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of
wickedness.)     

(Luke 15:20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet
a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell
on his neck, and kissed him.) The son left his wondering and the sin of
the far country and came back home to his father. When he was still a
great distance away, his father saw him and had compassion and ran to him
and fell on his neck and kissed him. The fact that the father saw him
shows that the father was always looking for his son, just as God the
Father is always watching his children just waiting for the rebellious
ones to return. The father had compassion on him. God the Father always
has compassion on his children, especially for those who were lost and
have repented and returned to him. The father ran to him. The father ran
to him and did not even wait for his son to get there. The father here as
a type of God the Father shows God running to retrieve one of his lost
children who has repented and is returning back to him. This is the only
place in scripture where we see God running and when he does it is for a
repentant soul. God loves us so much that he wants to bring us home. When
the father reaches his son, he falls on his neck and kisses him. The son
would have been filthy with no shower in a long time and remember he just
came from the fields feeding swine an unclean animal, yet the father only
cares that his son has repented and returned home. God the Father also is
the same as he will clean us up and wants us to come to us with our filth
and let him do the cleaning.

(Luke 15:21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.) The
son tells his father that he has sinned against heaven and him and that he
was no longer worthy to be called his son. The son is admitting his sins
to God the Father here showing true repentance. He realizes that he is not
even worthy to still be called his son.

(Luke 15:22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best
robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his
feet:) The son never has a chance to tell his father that he wants to be
one of his hired servants as the father tells his servants to bring forth
the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on
his feet. The father does not even have his son get cleaned up first
before clothing him with his best robe and shoes. The father knows he can
always buy new clothes, but his son returning is far more important than
these material items. This is a sign of not only God the Father clothing
his children and providing for them and in essence covering up their filth
and sin, but also how God the Father has unlimited wealth and can easily
replace these items later. The fact that the father placed a ring on his
son shows that the father's wealth was once again the sons. The shoes show
that the father thought he was still worthy to be called his son and
normally servants did not wear shoes, but the son of a wealthy father
would.

(Luke 15:23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us
eat, and be merry:) The father says to bring a fatted calf, kill it, and
let them eat and for all to be happy. The father would have brought his
best. God only always gives us his best.

(Luke 15:24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was
lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.) The father says his son
was dead, but is alive again. The son was lost, but is found. The son had
repented and so was once again alive and has returned to the father. He is
no longer lost. They all began to be merry as they rejoiced at the return
of the son. You can only be merry when walking with God. This is the same
as the first two parables I mentioned in this chapter as heaven rejoices
over just one lost sinner who repents and is found. This parable consists
of 22 verses with 22 meaning light. It is God alone who brings us true
light and the son has finally realized this. This parable is found in
chapter 15 and 15 means rest. An unrepentant Christian will only have rest
when they repent and return to God the Father who gives us our rest.   

(Luke 15:25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and
drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.) The elder son was in
the field and came to the house and heard musick and dancing.

(Luke 15:26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these
things meant.) He asked one of the servants what these things meant with
all of the musick and dancing. Notice that this father has many servants.
Only the rich have servants. God the Father also has many servants as
Christians that are walking with him will willingly serve God the Father
and God owns all.

(Luke 15:27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father
hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.)
The servant tells the elder son that the music and dancing is because his
brother has come home and is safe and sound and so his father had killed a
fatted calf for him.

(Luke 15:28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
father out, and intreated him.) The elder son was angry and would not go
in to enjoy the festivities. The son was jealous and sin was showing here.
As Christians we should never be jealous of another Christian, but should
always rejoice when a brother in Christ repents of their sins and returns
to walking with the Lord. Since the son would not go in then the father
came out to him and intreated or asked urgently what was the son's
problem. God always is urgent in asking us to tell us what is wrong. He
wants to know what he can do to make it better just like this father with
his son.

(Luke 15:29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years
do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and
yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:)
The son tells his father that he had served him all these years and had
never sinned and obeyed his commandments and yet his father had never
given him a kid so that he could be merry with his friends. Here the son
is sinning by being jealous of his brother.

(Luke 15:30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured
thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.) The
son continues to tell the father that he had never given him a kid, yet
his brother who had spent all of his money on harlots returns and he kills
a fatted calf for him. The elder son was saying I never even got a kid
which is a baby goat, yet his brother who lived a life of sin got a fatted
calf which is worth much more.

(Luke 15:31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all
that I have is thine.) The father told his son that he was forever with
him and all that he had was his sons as well. God the Father also shares
his riches with us. This verse shows that those of us who are saved will
forever be with God the Father.

(Luke 15:32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for
this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
found.) The father says that it was meet or worthy to make merry and be
glad because his brother had been dead, but was alive again and had been
lost, but was now found. The father was saying that the riotous son had
been dead to them as he chose to abandon the father and live a life of
sin, but now he had repented and so was alive again and was found as he
returned home to his father. We are all lost and dead without God the
Father in our lives. The father was trying to teach the elder son to learn
that we all must rejoice when a Christian repents and turns back to God
the Father in righteousness. Those who are already walking with God must
never feel neglected by God the Father because he is focused on a
wandering son.

For those who are saved this Father's Day then rejoice that you are
and let us pray for those brothers and sisters in Christ that are
wandering and rejoice when they return. This parable by Jesus clearly
shows how God the Father loves all of his children and no matter how much
we may wander from him, he will never give up on us, stop looking for us,
or be thankful when we return to us. For those wandering Christians, today
is the day to repent and return to God the Father. He will receive you
with open arms and has the best he has to offer waiting for you with him
in heaven. Let us thank God that we have a loving father like God the
Father that we can call Father and he will take us back no matter what we
have done. God never disowns his children. He will discipline them, but he
will never forsake them. Remember this and call upon the Father in
repentance now. For those Christians who are walking with God, continue to
walk with God and stay on the path of righteousness. Do not become like
the riotous son and rebel. If you do, then become like the repentant son.
For those who are not saved, please repent and admit you are a sinner and
need the Son Jesus Christ as your Saviour and that he died for you, was
buried, and rose again on that third day. Call upon Jesus today as your
Saviour so that God the Father will be your Father too. There is no better
Father's Day gift that a son can give their father today than to be saved.
