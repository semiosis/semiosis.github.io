Jesus is the Light of the World and Christians Should Reflect that Light

What the Holy Ghost has given me today I pray that I will do well and
he speaks through me.

We see in scripture that Jesus is the light of the world.

John 1:1-9 1 IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.

2 The same was in the beginning with God.

3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that
was made.

4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

6 ¶ There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men
through him might believe. (notice Light is capitalized)

8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the
world.

John 3:19-21 19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the
world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
evil.

20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made
manifest, that they are wrought in God.

John 8:12 ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of
the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
the light of life.

John 9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

John 12:35-36 35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the
light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you:
for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.

36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children
of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself
from them.

John 12:46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on
me should not abide in darkness.

Matthew 4:12-16 12 ¶ Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into
prison, he departed into Galilee;

13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the
sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet,
saying,

15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea,
beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat
in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. (refers to Jesus.
Only Jesus can bring us light)

Luke 2:28-32 28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and
said,

29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
word:

30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.

(Simeon said this when Mary came to bring her sacrifice after her
purification after the birth of Jesus. This proves she was not born
without sin as the Roman Catholics say. Jesus needed no sacrifice for
himself.)

Psalm 97:10-11 10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the
souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

Acts 26:17-18 17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles,
unto whom now I send thee,

18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from
the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins,
and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
(Paul was recounting his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus)
(Paul was to tell the people about the light of Jesus)

Paul spoke of seeing a bright light from heaven brighter than the sun
that shone on him and those with him and they were afraid and then Jesus
spoke out of that light. Jesus was that light. (Acts chapters 9, 22 and
26)

I John 1:5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and
declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. (We
know Jesus is God) [See John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God.]

II Samuel 22:29 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
darkness.

Psalm 119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

(John 1:1 and John 1:14 tells us the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.
The Word is Jesus)

Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
God.

Genesis 1:3-4 3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from
the darkness.

Jesus was the light on earth before the sun was created. He created
darkness. (Isaiah 45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make
peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.) The sun was
created on day four, but plants on day three. They had light from Jesus.
This contradicts evolution. The sun is a type of Jesus and the moon is a
type of Christians. 

Revelation 21:23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon,
to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the
light thereof. (refers to new Jerusalem) (There are many more verses that
show Jesus is the light of the world)

II Corinthians 4:6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of
darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of
the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

The transfiguration of Jesus showed Jesus's true nature.

Matthew 17:1-2  1 AND after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John
his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,

2 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and
his raiment was white as the light.

Hanukkah is the Jewish Festival of Lights. Jesus celebrated it where
it is referred to as the feast of dedication. If you study the scriptures,
Jesus was most likely born on the feast of tabernacles (John 1:14 says And
the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the
glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.) We
know the Word is Jesus and the word dwelt in Greek means to tabernacle.
This is like someone who is born on Christmas and we say he Christmased
with us. I believe the Holy Ghost was giving us a clue that Jesus was born
on the feast of tabernacles and if you go back 9 months for gestation then
Jesus was most likely conceived on Hanukkah which is appropriate as Jesus
is the light of the world conceived on the festival of lights or feast of
dedication as Jesus is dedicated to the world.

Luke 23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over
all the earth until the ninth hour. (noon until 3 pm) There was darkness
because the light of the world was dying for the whole worlds sins
including mine and yours and God the Father could not look at him. Without
the light of Jesus there is no light on earth.

Many examples in the Old Testament such as the candlestick in the
tabernacle (which gives off light) are a type of Jesus.

Many numbers in scripture have meaning such as five means grace,
three is divine completeness, seven is perfection (even the casual reader
of scripture sees a significance in the number seven), 16 means love for
you romantics, 50 represents the Holy Ghost. The number 22 means light.
The number 14 means salvation and 8 is new beginning or new birth. 14
(salvation) + 8 (new birth) = 22 (light) or Jesus.

There are seven types of light in nature: visible light, infrared,
x-rays, gamma rays, microwaves, radio waves and ultraviolet light.

The colors also have meanings such as green means life, purple
royalty and blue means separation or division. This is seen in the Old
Testament priests robes which were blue as they were separated for service
to God and the veil in the temple was also blue which separated the holy
of holies from the rest of the temple. We know the rainbow represents
God's promise to never destroy the world with a global flood again
(Genesis 9:12-16), but the colors of the rainbow together represent the
story of redemption of our salvation. The rainbow is seen behind God's
throne in Revelation 4:3. (Revelation 4:3 And he that sat was to look upon
like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the
throne, in sight like unto an emerald.) The rainbow reflects refracted
light just as Christians should reflect the light of Jesus and his story
of salvation. Genesis 9:14 says And it shall come to pass, when I bring a
cloud over the earth, that the bow (rainbow) shall be seen in the cloud:
(All clouds have a rainbow and can be seen with the right equipment or
conditions though we see very few, but God sees a rainbow and remembers
his covenant each time there is a cloud. The Holy Bible is proven right
again). Each individual Christian should be a cloud that tells the story
of redemption to the lost world. 

Light has different properties that represent the Godhead. X-rays,
gamma rays, radio waves, and ultraviolet light cannot be seen or felt just
as God the Father cannot be seen or felt. Visible light can be seen and
felt just as Jesus could be seen and felt. Infrared light cannot be seen
but can be felt just as the Holy Ghost cannot be seen but can be felt. Not
sure on microwaves. They are not seen and some say not felt, but others
say they can burn you, but they still may not be felt before burning you.
Not sure.

The unsaved often like the night time such as thieves as seen in many
places in scripture.  Light is compared to good and God and darkness to
evil throughout scripture. Light represents truth.

An example of good is evil and evil is good and truth is twisted is
seen by the Hindus of India who celebrate Diwali every October or
November. Satan always tries to copy God. Diwali symbolizes the spiritual
"victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over
ignorance". Businesses are closed and candles and lights lit and it lasts
five days. Let us pray Hindus get true victory over darkness and turn to
the true light of Jesus.

Jesus said he is God when he said his seven I am statements such as
he said I am the door, I am the way, the truth and the life, and I am the
light of the world. Moses was told to tell the people I AM sent him.

Jesus tells us in plain English that even a child or one uneducated
can understand that he is the light of the world. (John 8:12 ¶ Then spake
Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that
followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
life.)

Through these verses and illustrations we see Jesus is the light of
the world.

We as Christians are to represent and reflect the light of Jesus to
others and be a lighthouse unto the lost and dying world.

As I read earlier in John 12:36 While ye have light, believe in the
light, that ye may be the children of light.

Matthew 5:14-16 14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an
hill cannot be hid.

15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a
candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.

16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

Luke 16:8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than
the children of light. (here in the parable of the unjust steward
Christians are referred to as children of light, but are not wise as they
should be)

I Thessalonians 5:5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of
the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

The following are some things that keep a Christian from growing and
their light shining brightly.  All of these things apply to me as well. I
am preaching to myself at the same time as all of you.  When you point a
finger at someone, three are pointing back at yourself.

Christians need to live their lives in a way that reflects Jesus
(Light).  Christians should be putting God first in all that we do. Like
it or not the world watches anyone who professes to be a Christian.
Christians should not be using alcohol, tobacco, gambling including buying
lottery tickets, going to the casinos (even eating there which only
supports an ungodly establishment) or getting tattoos or piercings all
over their body. Christians should not be cursing and also need to be
careful how they speak such as being rude. They are not to be politically
correct, but need to be tactful and gentler as not to hurt our Christian
brothers or sisters. Do not give evil looks and watch the tone of your
voice when speaking. Christians need to act their age both physically and
spiritually whether 8 or 80. One who professes to have been a Christian
for 50 years should not still be drinking milk, but should be eating meat
and teaching babes in Christ. Christians should not be watching or looking
at pornography, telling or listening to dirty jokes, lusting after the
opposite sex, watching television shows or movies that mock sin and
blasphemy God. Christians should not watch or read books and movies that
promote witchcraft such as Harry Potter (the spells in the stories are
real with only a few words supposedly left out and these books are
supposedly written by a professing Christian) and the Wizard of Oz. God
hates witchcraft. There is no white or black witchcraft. It is all evil
from Satan. God compares rebellion to witchcraft. (I Samuel 15:23 For
rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and
idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also
rejected thee from being king.) Christians should not be Masons (All of
the top Masons worship Satan). Christians should be in church whenever
possible and not make excuses not to come. Do not put sports, family,
money or anything else before God. Vote according to what scriptures says
on issues and not our personal feelings. Christians need to use their
money wisely and spend more for the Lord and need to tithe. (The word
tithe means 10% and people need to tithe based on their gross income, not
net. Do not try to steal or cheat God. He only asks for 10% when it all
belongs to him. God told the Jews in Malachi 3:8 that they had robbed him.
They said where and God said in tithes and offerings. Offerings is
anything above the 10%). Even if one is poor they still need to tithe. God
will bless them just like the poor widow who threw in all she had with her
last mite. God does not need our money, he wants our obedience. (Malachi
3:8 ¶ Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have
we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.) Christians need to do more than
live their lives as an example. People need to see Christians in action
and not just talk. We all need to tell others about Jesus, invite people
especially the lost to church. Offer to drive them there. Christians need
to use the King James Bible and avoid all other versions including the New
King James Version as all others have been corrupted and influenced by
man, the Roman Catholic Church and Satan. Christians should not commit
adultery (Jesus said in Matthew 5:28 That whosever looketh on a woman to
lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.)
[Many women are guilty as well]. Christians should not be getting divorced
(this is unacceptable, rate as high as the unsaved and you took an oath
before God), living together when not married, dating and marrying unsaved
people as scripture says we are not to be unequally yoked one to another.
(II Corinthians 6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers:
for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what
communion hath light with darkness?) Christians should not be gossiping,
should not be listening to Rock and Roll or rap music including so called
Christian rock and Christian rap and most of the contemporary Christian
music. This kind of music is from Satan and does not honor or please God.
One should dress up for God. It need not be a suit, but wear the best that
you have. Women make sure you are not wearing revealing clothing.

Matthew 5:13 ¶ Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing,
but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

All of us are guilty of one or more of these sins or some other sins
and need to confess them before Jesus, repent and try to not repeat them.

The following will help Christians to grow and shine brightly:

Christians need to read and study (these are not the same) scripture
everyday (no excuses). Christians need to pray every day for the lost as
well as for our church family, nation, Christians in bonds and those being
persecuted for Jesus, etc. Christians should not be lying and should be
examples to the lost. Love our neighbors and enemies even when difficult.

All Christians should find a way to serve Jesus and reach the lost.
One is never to old or young to serve Jesus. Moses was 80 when God called
him to stand before Pharaoh and free his people from Egypt, cross the Red
sea, receive the ten commandments and lead the people in the wilderness
for forty years. He served until his death at 120. Aaron was 83 when he
was called by God to be a priest and served until is death at 123. Noah
was 600 when he went aboard the ark. Abraham was 75 when he departed out
of Haran. Jack Chick continued to serve the Lord and reach the lost by
writing and drawing new tracts until his death at 92. Tim Lahaye of the
Left Behind book series, continued to write books for God until his death
at age 90. Neither are you too young to serve. Samuel served with Eli the
priest from a very young age and Samson also served from a young age.
There are no excuses, even if you are in bad health. (Tell story of lady
with polio and in iron lung who led a Sunday School or bus ministry).
Whether through giving out tracts (tell of my ministry), telling people
about Jesus, giving people Holy Bibles, starting a website, a ministry, or
using social media such as Facebook. One can teach, give out cd's or
dvd's  of stories of Jesus as well. One can serve on mission trips, give
money to missionaries or support various Christian ministries. There are
many ways to serve. Every Christian is given a gift or gifts from the Holy
Ghost and needs to use it to honor and serve the Lord such as if you are
an artist, writer or musician use it all for the glory of God. Just as in
the military there are those who serve on the front lines, those in the
rear that support those on the front and then those who serve in factories
to make the weapons for those on the front. Christians can also serve in
one of those three spots. All Christians can at least pray for those who
are serving. Christians should be kind, gentle and caring and should show
the fruit of the Spirit of Galatians 5:22-23. The people around you at
work, school, family or friends should know you are a Christian and what
you believe. Christians should not be ashamed of Jesus and should not be
embarrassed to pray in public or around coworkers, schoolmates or others
for our food or other reasons for praying.

Satan was originally Lucifer which means light bearer. Satan was
meant to reflect the light of God (of Jesus I believe), but failed when he
rebelled against God. We as Christians must not fail to reflect and shine
the light of God. If Christians truly want revival, then just as the moon
reflects the light of the sun, they need to make sure they are reflecting
the light of the Son of God Jesus Christ. As the sign above the sanctuary
as you exit at Southside Baptist Church says "Go Forth To Serve." 

If one is not saved, today is the day of salvation, repent, admit
that you are a sinner, realize you need a Saviour and that Jesus died in
your place for your sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day and
ask Jesus to save you so you too may come out of the darkness into the
light and can reflect the light of Jesus.
