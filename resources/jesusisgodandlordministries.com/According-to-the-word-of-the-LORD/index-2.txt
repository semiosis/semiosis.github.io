According to the word of the LORD

The words "according to the word of the LORD" have two meanings
in scripture. The first is if God says something is going to happen then
it will happen according to the word of the LORD. The second thing is that
everyone, but especially we as Christians need to obey God according to
the word of the LORD. We need to be always obedient to the word of God,
but we first must listen so we can hear the word of the LORD to know what
he wants us to do according to his word.

We see things happen according to the word of the LORD. When God says
it will happen, you can guarantee that it will come true. When a man of
God from Judah went to Bethel to see Jeroboam the king of Israel, he was
told by God not to stay there and eat or drink water. He left, but later
was stopped and lied to by another prophet and he ate with him. God later
had the man of God torn apart by a lion for disobeying him just as he said
he would. (I Kings 13:22 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk
water in the place, of the which the LORD did say to thee, Eat no bread,
and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy
fathers.) (I Kings 13:26 And when the prophet that brought him back from
the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient
unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the
lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the
LORD, which he spake unto him.) Let this be an example to always do what
God says to us even if someone else claims to have had a new revelation
for us by God.

Jeroboam's son was sick and dying and he sought the prophet Ahijah to
see if he would live. Ahijah said the child would die due to the sins of
Jeroboam. The child died just as was spoken by God according to his word.
(I Kings 14:12 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when
thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.) (I Kings 14:18 And
they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of
the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.)

When Joshua and the Israelites destroyed Jericho, Joshua said that
God said no one was to rebuild Jericho. Anyone who did would have the life
of their firstborn taken for laying the foundation and the youngest son
for setting up the gates. Hiel disobeyed God and his sons died according
to the word of the LORD. (Joshua 6:26 ¶ And Joshua adjured them at that
time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and
buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his
firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.) (I
Kings 16:34 ¶ In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid
the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates
thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD,
which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.)

Elijah told a widow woman that was on the verge of death as was her
son to make him a cake with her last bits of meal and oil and if she
obeyed, God would keep it from being empty until it rained. She obeyed the
word of the LORD from Elijah and God did according to his word and
preserved the meal and oil until it rained. (I Kings 17:14 For thus saith
the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall
the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the
earth.) (I Kings 17:16 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the
cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by
Elijah.)

Ahaziah the king of Israel fell and was near death, so he sent
messengers to enquire from the false god Baal whether he would live or
not. Elijah stopped them and told them thus saith the LORD that the king
would die since he sought help from Baal rather than from God. (II Kings
1:6 And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto
us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus
saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou
sendest to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt
not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely
die.) (II Kings 1:17 ¶ So he died according to the word of the LORD which
Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of
Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.) Let
this be a lesson to always seek help from God, not a false god or even a
physician. Pray first and see what God wants us to do.

The Israelites were under siege by the Syrians and were starving to
death and down to the last drops of food when Elijah prophesied according
to the word of the LORD that the next day the Israelites would have plenty
of food and would sell a measure of fine flour for a shekel and two
measures of barley for a shekel. This came to pass after four leprous men
found the food that the Syrians had left behind when God scared the
Syrians away. (II Kings 7:1 Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the
LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of
fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,
in the gate of Samaria.) (II Kings 7:16 And the people went out, and
spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for
a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word
of the LORD.)

The prophets of the old testament would speak for God and say "Thus
saith the LORD" and if they were really speaking for the LORD it would
always come true according to the word of the LORD.

We see in all of these examples that when God says he will do
something it will always be fulfilled according to his word. Let us also
obey him since we know he will do as he says he will do. This should
comfort us Christians knowing that the rapture, a future mansion, and
everlasting life will also come just as God said according to his word.
God has magnified his word above his name showing how important his word
is when he says something. (Psalm 138:2 I will worship toward thy holy
temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for
thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.)

God expects obedience from us when he speaks especially from his
children (saved people). (Leviticus 22:31 Therefore shall ye keep my
commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.) (John 14:23 Jesus answered and
said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will
love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.)

The first time the phrase "according to the word of the LORD" is
found in scripture is in Numbers 3:16 when God commands Moses to number
the children of Levi and Moses obeys God's word. (Numbers 3:16 And Moses
numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded.)
Many times Moses obeyed God by doing according to the word of the LORD.
(Numbers 3:51 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto
Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD
commanded Moses.) (Numbers 4:45 These be those that were numbered of the
families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to
the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.)

After the children of Israel divided their inheritance, they obeyed
God's word and gave a city to Joshua. (Joshua 19:50 According to the word
of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in
mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.) Jeremiah did as
God said when he got a linen girdle and put it upon his loins. (Jeremiah
13:1-2 1 Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and
put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.
2 So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my
loins.) Jonah did according to the word of the LORD and preached to his
enemies in Nineveh where they repented and God spared the city from
destruction for many years. Many people were saved who would not have been
if Jonah had not done according to the word of the LORD. Jonah did not
originally want to obey, but he did finally obey. Let this be a lesson to
Christians that by disobeying God we may cost the salvation of people
because we refused to go preach to them. God would also rather have a
Jonah who refused at first, but then repented and obeyed than a person who
says he will obey, but never does. See the two sons parable in Matthew
21:28-31. (Matthew 21:28-31 ¶ But what think ye? A certain man had two
sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my
vineyard.
29 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said,
I go, sir: and went not.
31 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him,
The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.) (Jonah
3:2-3 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the
preaching that I bid thee.
3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the
LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.)
Just as these people obeyed according to the word of the LORD, we need to
do the same.     

God will honour those who are obedient according to his word by doing
according to their word when they ask. God did according to the word of
Moses many times when he prayed to God because Moses was God's man.
(Exodus 8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses,
and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river
only.) (Exodus 8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and
the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the
fields.) (Exodus 8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I
will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh,
from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh
deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the
LORD.) (Exodus 8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and
he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from
his people; there remained not one.) Mary was told by the angel Gabriel
that things would happen according to his word which was spoken to her
according to the word of the LORD. Mary understood that the words of the
angel were actually the words from God about her upcoming pregnancy and
birth of her Saviour and Messiah Jesus and she was willing to be obedient.
God answered Mary by having her get impregnated by the Holy Ghost. (Luke
1:35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come
upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore
also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son
of God.) (Luke 1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it
unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.)

We see from these examples how it will come to pass according to the
word of the LORD and how we should obey God when he tells us to do
something according to his word since it will come to pass and we are to
obey God. God will honor those who obey him. The best way a person can
obey God is by admitting they are a sinner and calling upon his Son Jesus
to be their Saviour. Many great men have obeyed God by answering his call
to be preachers and missionaries. Many have made great sacrifices for God
for which they will be greatly rewarded in heaven. For a person and
especially a Christian to do according to the word of the LORD, everyone
must read and study scripture every day. You cannot do according to the
word of the LORD if you do not know the word of the LORD. We need to try
and memorize God's word so we will not forget it. Meditating on God's word
will help you not forget it. (Psalm 119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night
watches, that I might meditate in thy word.) (Psalm 119:15-16 15 I will
meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.
16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.) The
Holy Ghost will bring scripture back to you if you have memorized it.
(John 14:26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things
to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.)

Obeying God's word is not just for people, but for nations as well.
We the United States of America and all nations need to bless Israel just
as he says or according to his word we will be cursed. (Genesis 12:3 And I
will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in
thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.) (Genesis 27:29 Let
people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy
brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one
that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.) We as a nation
have seen this in the past both being blessed and cursed by God depending
on whether we obey or disobey God's word. Our nation is collapsing due to
not doing according to God's word. Murder and other crimes are rampant
throughout the nation as is disrespect to authority and parents. America
has become lazy when God says to work. America is becoming a socialist
nation. God will not bless a nation that is doing the things America is
doing. Let us pray for our nation and leaders to turn back to God and do
according to the word of the LORD.  

Let us cry unto the LORD as the psalmist did in Psalm 119:169 so that
he will give us understanding to do according to his word. God's word says
he will to those who ask. (Psalm 119:69 Let my cry come near before thee,
O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.) (James 1:5 If any of
you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.) God will do according to his
word in the future tribulation and let us pray that we do according to his
word by telling others about Jesus before it is eternity too late. Just as
God, I do not wish that any should perish nor wish the tribulation, hell,
and the lake of fire on anyone. (II Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack
concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering
to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come
to repentance.) I pray that all here today and those who are listening
feel the same way. For those who may be listening who are not saved,
please call upon Jesus for salvation today.
