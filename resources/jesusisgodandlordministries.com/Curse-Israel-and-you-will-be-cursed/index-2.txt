Curse Israel and you will be cursed

Once again we see Israel is under attack by her enemies. Members of
our government as well as other governments say Israel has no right to
defend herself after being attacked, yet these same people say their own
nations can defend themselves. Israel as a nation has the same rights as
any other nation including to defend herself. These same leaders also say
that Israel cannot decide where her capital is though every other
sovereign nation has that right. The world says the capital of Israel is
Tel Aviv, but God and Israel say it is Jerusalem. President Trump was
right in moving our embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing Jerusalem as
Israel's capital. Israel is God's chosen people. Satan knows this, so he
is always stirring up his people to try and destroy God's chosen people.
Many people are raised to hate Israel just for the sake of it, especially
Muslims and do not even know why. Our own government has for years tried
to make Israel give up land that God gave to her. Israel is the only
nation that has a right to her land. Even the United States of America
does not have that right. God gave the land to Israel and it belongs to no
one else despite what people are taught. (Genesis 15:18 In the same day
the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given
this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river
Euphrates:) (Genesis 17:19 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a
son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my
covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after
him.) These verses and many more show God promised the land to Israel
forever from Isaac, not Ishmael, and from Jacob, not Esau, so it does not
belong to the Muslims or Palestinians or anyone else. God said that if you
bless Israel, you will be blessed and if you curse Israel you will be
cursed. If you mess with God's chosen people, you will reap what you sow.
(Genesis 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that
curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.)
Isaac through God confirmed this blessing on Jacob, who was renamed Israel
by God. (Genesis 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to
thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to
thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that
blesseth thee.)

Scripture tells us of nations who tried to curse Israel and reaped
the consequences. Many nations and individuals have doubted God's word
that he would curse those who curse Israel and have tempted God not
believing he would keep his promise, but they all have found out God does
as he says he will. Balak the king of Moab hated the Israelites and wanted
them cursed. Balak along with the elders of Midian hired Balaam to come to
Moab to curse Israel. (Numbers 22:6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse
me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall
prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the
land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou
cursest is cursed.) Balak knew about being cursed if he cursed Israel, but
decided he could curse them anyway without any consequences. Balak
believed God would not follow through with his promise to Abraham. God
told Balaam not to go since the Israelites were blessed by him. (Numbers
22:12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt
not curse the people: for they are blessed.) Balaam ignored God and went
anyway to Moab. Along the way, Balaam had an encounter with the angel of
the LORD [preincarnate Jesus] after he had beaten his ass who had seen him
first. The ass spoke to Balaam. The angel of the LORD told Balaam to go to
Moab and see Balak, but he could only speak what God told him. Balaam was
asked by Balak to curse Israel, yet three times Balaam speaking for God
instead blessed Israel. Balaam said how can he curse whom God has not
cursed? (Numbers 23:8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how
shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?)  God had the final say. God
spoke through Balaam and again confirmed that those who curse Israel will
be cursed. (Numbers 24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great
lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed
is he that curseth thee.) Instead of Israel being cursed, Moab was. Both
Moab and the Midianites were ultimately destroyed at a later time by God
and neither nation exists today, but Israel does.

Jacob and his family settled in Egypt after Joseph was found to be
alive and second in command in Egypt, second only to pharaoh. Many years
later, other pharaohs made the Israelites slaves. The Israelites
population began to explode, and one pharaoh commanded that all male
children were to be killed when they were born. (Exodus 1:16 And he said,
When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon
the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a
daughter, then she shall live.) Years later Moses would go to pharaoh to
ask for him to let the Israelites go. Pharaoh refused and God sent the ten
plagues upon Egypt which destroyed most of their crops and cattle and
killed the firstborn of the Egyptians including the son of pharaoh.
Pharaoh after the loss of his son finally told Moses they could go. The
people spoiled the Egyptians of their jewels and goods before they left as
God had put this into the hearts of the people. (Exodus 12:36 And the LORD
gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent
unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.)
After the Israelites left, pharaoh changed his mind and he along with his
army chased after them and would all be destroyed by drowning and crushing
from the collapsing waters from the Red Sea which the Israelites had
previously crossed. (Exodus 15:4-5 4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath
he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
5The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.)
Egypt would never be the same and eventually would be conquered by the
Arabs. Egypt still exists today in name, but is inhabited by Arabs. The
Egyptian people of the scriptures no longer exist.

The Persian Haman despised the Jews and sought king Ahasuerus to make
an edict to kill the Jews. He also sought the death of Mordecai, cousin of
Queen Esther. (Esther 3:8-9 8 ¶ And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There
is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all
the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people;
neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's
profit to suffer them.
9If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and
I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have
the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.) Haman
built gallows that he wanted Mordecai hanged on. Instead God had Haman
hanged on his own gallows, Mordecai was elevated in the kingdom, and the
Jews today celebrate their victory over their enemies as the feast of
Purim.  

The Philistines for many years fought with Israel, held the
Israelites captive and treated them badly. The Philistine giant Goliath
defied the armies of the living God. (I Samuel 17:10 And the Philistine
said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may
fight together.) The teenage shepherd boy David killed Goliath with a
sling shot. Philistia no longer exists today. Assyria also fought with
Israel for many years and would eventually capture the ten northern
tribes. Assyria would be destroyed herself and no longer exists today.
Babylon captured Israel and held the people in captivity for seventy
years. God would have her captured by the Medo-Persian Empire who ruled
over the Jews for over 200 years until her capture by Greece. Only the
Persian part of the empire exists today and is known as Iran who is still
an enemy of Israel. Greece would be captured by the Roman Empire and rule
over the Jews. The Romans destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. The Roman Empire
no longer exists today as a nation, though the empire will revive for a
brief period during the tribulation to once again be the enemy of Israel.
Many other nations and peoples such as Edom, Tyre, the Amalekites, the
Ishmaelites, and the Ammonites fought against Israel and no longer exist
today. 

In the future during the Battle of Gog and Magog, the nations that
fight against Israel will be destroyed supernaturally by God when he
causes them to kill each other as well as send great hailstones, fire, and
brimstone. (Ezekiel 38:22 And I will plead against him with pestilence and
with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the
many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones,
fire, and brimstone.) These nations consist of Russia, Germany, and Muslim
nations, all longtime enemies of Israel. Some of the nations include
Turkey, Iran, Ethiopia, and Libya. (Ezekiel 38:2-6) Russia has persecuted
Jews for many years and led to her becoming a communist nation where her
people have suffered greatly. Germany during the Third Reich under Adolf
Hitler killed over six million Jews in the Holocaust during World War 2.
Germany was defeated, the Third Reich destroyed and Adolf Hitler committed
suicide. The Jews still survive.

During the tribulation, the antichrist will rule the world and he
will try to destroy Israel from the midpoint until the end. God will
ultimately save one third of the Jews and Jesus will rule from Jerusalem
during the millennium. The antichrist will be cast alive into the lake of
fire for all eternity for his part in cursing Israel.

God still curses the enemies of Israel today. Many people say the
curse only applied to Israel in the old testament and no longer applies
today. The curse is still very much in force today. During the Six Day
War, Israel greatly defeated her enemies who had attacked her. Israel
killed about 20,000 of her enemy at a loss of less than 1,000 of her own
military. Israel destroyed the Egyptian Air Force. The war was started
because Egypt denied Israeli ships access to the Straits of Tiran, but
allowed other nations. God cursed the nations which fought against Israel
and they were swiftly defeated. The British Empire came to an end due to
Great Britain cursing the Jews by passing the White Paper, a law and
policy that restricted how many Jews could go to the British mandate of
Palestine, an area that is now controlled by Israel, and some Arab
nations. The British allowed an unlimited amount of Arabs to enter the
land, but restricted the number of Jews and also wanted an Arab nation,
but not a nation of Israel. This policy ultimately cost millions of Jews
their lives as they tried to escape Europe and the Holocaust. Great
Britain prevented the Jews from coming here and sent them back to Europe
and their deaths. God took away the empire from the British because of
this. Over the centuries, many nations such as Spain in 1492 and England
in 1290 have expelled all Jews from the nation and these nations were
ultimately punished by God.

The United States of America has her own share of curses from cursing
Israel. President Franklin D. Roosevelt denied a Jewish ship the M.S. St.
Louis carrying 937 Jews from landing in the United States in 1939. The
Jews were trying to escape Nazi Germany. They were sent back to Germany
and over a third of them were killed. President Roosevelt also made a deal
with king Saud of Saudi Arabia in 1945 to prevent the establishment of
Israel. Roosevelt died a week after sending the letter to the king. In
October 1991 President George H.W. Bush made plans to force Israel to give
up lands in the Madrid Peace Conference. On the day the president attended
the conference, a giant hurricane known as the "Perfect Storm" slammed
into the president's house in Kennebunkport, Maine causing great damage.
This storm had over 100 foot waves and appeared out of nowhere. Just as
the president wanted to force Israeli houses to be destroyed, God
destroyed his. On August 24, 1992, the Madrid Peace Conference was moved
to Washington, D.C. On the same day Hurricane Andrew hit Florida causing
great damage. This conference intended to divide the land of Israel. In
1997 President Clinton welcomed the Palestinian leader, Nasser Arafat to
America and condemned Israel for building houses in their own land that
Clinton believed did not belong to them. The same day Arafat landed in the
U.S., powerful tornadoes hit the U.S. Many severe tornado outbreaks
occurred throughout his time here in the U.S. On November 11, 2001,
Secretary of State Colin Powell met with Arafat in the United Nations
building in New York City about creating a Palestinian state. The next day
in New York City a plane crashed killing 265 people. John T. McTernan has
written a great book As America Has Done To Israel. In this book he shows
these things and many more how every time the U.S. tried to make Israel
give up land or in some other way curse Israel, then great disasters hit
the United States such as hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires, or other
disasters. Most hit within twenty four hours of the curse. It is not a
coincidence that time and time again whenever the U.S. or any nation
curses Israel, that they are cursed. God will always curse those who curse
Israel. These things clearly show that the curse is alive today and was
not just for old testament times. That is just another way Satan gets
people to believe in the false replacement theology.

Today we need to remember Israel and the Jewish people in our
prayers. We need to pray for the peace of Jerusalem as God has commanded
us to do. (Psalm 122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper
that love thee.) We need to stand for Israel as individual people and as a
nation. Let us pray for those ministries that are reaching out to the Jews
to tell them about Jesus. The Jews will always be God's chosen people.
They have not been replaced by the church as the Roman Catholics and many
others falsely teach in what is known as Replacement Theology. Vote for
leaders in government that stand for Israel and her people. God said he
would bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel. God
does not change and does not lie. He keeps his promises. (Hebrews 13:8
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.) (Malachi 3:6
For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
consumed.) The United States has done her share of cursing Israel and is
now reaping some of that fruit and will pay for it just as every other
nation that has cursed Israel has. Let us today repent of our nations sins
against Israel and pray for peace in Israel.
