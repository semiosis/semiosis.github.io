Pre-incarnate Appearances of Jesus (Theophanies)

The Gospel of John shows us the genealogy of Jesus showing he is the Son
of God.

John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God.

John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace
and truth.

We know Jesus has no beginning.

The pre-incarnate appearances of Jesus are referred to as theophanies
or occasionally Christophanies. Theophany means appearance of God and
Christophany means appearance of Christ. A pre-incarnate appearance of
Jesus refers to an appearance by Jesus normally in a visible form usually
of a man in the Old Testament prior to his being born by Mary in
Bethlehem. Often times this is seen by him being referred to as the angel
of the LORD, but not always. (angel of God) Often we see people
recognizing they had seen God and or worshipped the angel of the LORD
showing he was God. Some appearances are seen below. 

1. The first appearance of Jesus is seen I believe in Genesis Chapter 3. I
believe Jesus walked with them in the garden of Eden prior to their fall
and not just spoke to them from heaven.

Jesus appeared to Abraham on more than one occasion.

2. When Abraham was in the plain of Moreh shortly after he left Haran
after being told by God to go to the land of Canaan. He was 75.

Genesis 12:7-8 7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed
will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who
appeared unto him.

8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and
pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and
there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the
LORD.

3. After Abraham rescued Lot after he had been captured by several kings
who made war with the king of Sodom, he was visited by Melchizedek, the
king of Salem.

(Genesis 14:18-20 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and
wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God,
possessor of heaven and earth:
20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies
into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.)

Abraham tithed Melchizedek recognizing his importance. Melchizedek was the
priest of the most high God. I believe Melchizedek was Jesus. We see this
in Hebrews Chapters 5 and 7 with five meaning grace and seven completeness
or spiritual perfection.

(Hebrews 7:1-4 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most
high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and
blessed him;

2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem,
which is, King of peace;

3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither
beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God;
abideth a priest continually.

4 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch
Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.)

(Hebrews 7:17:For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the
order of Melchisedec.)

If you will notice, you will see that in Hebrews 7:2 King is capitalized.
King is only capitalized in the King James Bible when referring to Jesus
as Jesus is King of kings. There are only three exceptions when king
starts a sentence or quote and all words in the Bible including "and" are
capitalized at the beginning of a sentence or quote. This is not the case
in the corrupt non King James Bibles such as the New International Version
(NIV), New King James Version (NKJV), New Living Translation (NLT),
English Standard Version (ESV), or Holman Christian Standard Bible (HCSB)
(Southern Baptist version) where they capitalize king for all earthly
kings. That is not correct or Biblical.

4. We read in Genesis 18 how Jesus and two angels appeared to Abraham, ate
with him, and then Jesus told Abraham how he was going to destroy Sodom
and Gomorrah and the cities around them for their sins. Abraham's nephew
Lot lives in Sodom and so Abraham tries to bargain with God to save Lot.
Abraham asked God to spare Sodom if there were only 50 righteous, 45, 40,
30, 20, and finally ten.

(Genesis 18:1-3 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and
he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and
when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed
himself toward the ground,

3 And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not
away, I pray thee, from thy servant:)

(Genesis 18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing
with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.)

5. Jesus appeared to Isaac in Beersheba:

(Genesis 26:24-25 24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and
said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,
and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.

25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD,
and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.)

Jacob wrestled Jesus the night before he met with Esau after he escaped
from Laban with his family after serving for Leah and Rachel.

(Genesis 32:24-32 24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man
with him until the breaking of the day.

25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the
hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as
he wrestled with him.

26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not
let thee go, except thou bless me.

27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as
a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he
said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him
there.

30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face
to face, and my life is preserved.

31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon
his thigh.

32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank,
which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched
the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.)

6. Moses and burning bush.

Moses had been out attending his father in law Jethro's flock of sheep,
when he saw the burning bush.

(Exodus 3:2-6 2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of
fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush
burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the
bush is not burnt.

4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him
out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,
Here am I.

5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet,
for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was
afraid to look upon God.)

7. Jesus appeared to Moses and others just before he received the ten
commandments.

(Exodus 24:9-11 9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and
seventy of the elders of Israel:

10 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were
a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven
in his clearness.

11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand:
also they saw God, and did eat and drink.)

8. We see Jesus appear to Balaam after he was told not to go and curse
Israel after he was asked by the king of Moab (Balak) The king of Moab had
asked Balaam to come to Moab and curse Israel because he was afraid of
them. Balaam at first refused and then agreed to go, but said he would
only go if God allowed him and would only say what God gave him to say. On
the way, God was angry with Balaam and used a talking ass (donkey) to get
Balaam's attention.

(Numbers 22:22-35 22 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the
angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he
was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.

23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his
sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went
into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.

24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the
wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.

26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place,
where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam:
and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.

28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam,
What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?

29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would
there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.

30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast
ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto
thee? And he said, Nay.

31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the
LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed
down his head, and fell flat on his face.

32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten
thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee,
because thy way is perverse before me:

33 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she
had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.

34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew
not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it
displease thee, I will get me back again.

35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only
the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam
went with the princes of Balak.)

9. Appearance to Gideon:

(Judges 6:11-21 11 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an
oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his
son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the
Midianites.

12 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The
LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then
is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers
told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the
LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

14 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou
shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?

15 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel?
behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's
house.

16 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt
smite the Midianites as one man.

17 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew
me a sign that thou talkest with me.

18 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth
my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou
come again.

19 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an
ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a
pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.

20 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened
cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.

21 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in
his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose
up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes.
Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.)

Gideon went on to defeat the Midianites and became a judge of Israel.

10. Story of Manoah with Samson.

(Judges 13:3 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said
unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt
conceive, and bear a son.)

(Judges 13:8-22 8 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let
the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what
we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

9 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came
again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her
husband was not with her.

10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said
unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me
the other day.

11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and
said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said,
I am.

12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the
child, and how shall we do unto him?

13 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the
woman let her beware.

14 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her
drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I
commanded her let her observe.

15 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain
thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

16 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I
will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou
must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he wasan angel of
the LORD.

17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when
thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

18 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my
name, seeing it is secret?

19 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock
unto the LORD: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife
looked on.

20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the
altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And
Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.

21 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife.
Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have
seen God.)

11. Sennacherib the king of Assyria sent his troops to surround Jerusalem
and try and convince Judah to surrender to him. Hezekiah the king of Judah
had prayed to God to protect Judah and Isaiah told Hezekiah that God had
heard his pray. Here is God's answer.

(Isaiah 37:36 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp
of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they
arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses) (185,000
dead) The king of Assyria went back home and was killed by his sons.

12. In the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego they had refused to
bow down to the gold statue of king Nebuchadnezzar that he made from the
vision in his dream. The statue was (60 cubits high) 90 feet high and (6
cubits wide) 9 feet wide and all were to bow to it when the king had music
played. The Hebrew boys refused and were thrown into the fiery furnace
made seven times hotter than usually done. Jesus appeared to the men.

(Daniel 3:22-26 22 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent,
and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that
took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound
into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in
haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men
bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king,
True, O king.

25 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of
the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the
Son of God.

26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery
furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants
of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.)

(Capital S for Son in the proper King James Bible.) (not a son of the gods
such as in New International Version (NIV), et cetera. This was Jesus,
despite that many try to deny it.) Nebuchadnezzar did not invite Jesus to
come out of the fire which I find interesting. I pray that all who are
reading this will invite Jesus into their heart and lives.

13. When Moses was getting ready to transfer leadership to Joshua just
before his death, Jesus appeared before the two as a cloud.

(Deuteronomy 31:14-15 14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days
approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the
tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses
and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the
congregation.

15 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the
pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.)

14. The LORD appeared to Samuel.

God called Samuel when he was a young boy living with the high priest Eli.

(I Samuel 3:10 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.) (I
Samuel 3:21 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.)

15. Jesus was also with the Israelites in the wilderness as a cloud by day
and a pillar of fire by night. Jesus also appeared in visions and dreams
and spoke to others such as Hagar when she fled from Sarai. The angel of
the Lord appeared to Hagar and told her she would give birth to Ishmael
and her son would be a wild man. There are other appearances in the
scriptures other than those I presented such as when Moses saw the back of
God. This was Jesus. All physical appearances of God in the Old Testament
were of Jesus.

Theophanies are only in the Old Testament for once Jesus was born as
a man in the flesh they were no longer needed.
