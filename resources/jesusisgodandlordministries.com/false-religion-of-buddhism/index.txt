False Religion of Buddhism

Buddhism is the world's fourth largest religion with over 520 million
Buddhists. Buddhism is found mostly in the Far East part of Asia and is
the dominant religion in places such as Vietnam, China, Japan, Thailand,
Laos, Cambodia, Mongolia, Burma, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka, and Singapore.
Buddhism shares many similar beliefs with Hinduism and other Eastern
religions. Buddhism consists of many traditions, teachings, philosophies,
beliefs, and spiritual practices. There are two major branches of
Buddhism, Theravada (The school of the Elders) and Mahayana (The Great
Vehicle) with Mahayana the more popular. Vajrayana is another branch.
Theravada is the more conservative of the two and has many more monks in
monasteries believing that meditation will lead to "salvation". The
different groups have different schools with some differences in beliefs.
One of the best known schools of Mahayana is Zen Buddhism which originated
in China. The symbol of Buddhism is the eight spoke wheel known as the
Dharma. Buddhists worship at temples.

Buddhism was founded in India by Gautama Buddha. Buddhism still has
many converts in India, though it has been mostly replaced by Hinduism.
Buddha is revered by Buddhists and is referred to as an enlightened being.
Supposedly Buddha gave up his wealth and spent several years in
meditation, refraining from pleasures of life, and other things and then
claimed to have figured out how to end the cycle of reincarnation to reach
nirvana. It was not until a couple of centuries after his death that he
was given the name Buddha meaning enlightened one. It is not known exactly
when Buddha started Buddhism, but it is believed to be around 500-400 BC.
Many Buddhist monks today live in monasteries spending their days in
meditation and chanting. God said we are not to just repeat words or
humming. (Matthew 6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the
heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much
speaking.) God also said to meditate on his word, not empty our minds the
way Buddhists do while meditating which only opens the door to Satan.
(Ephesians 5:18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be
filled with the Spirit;) Most Buddhist monks shave their head bald or some
have the hair shaved short, but not bald like a bald man, though most do
have the bald look. Buddhists will often have a Buddha idol (statue) in
their homes. This is their god, though they will not say that.

Buddhism has becoming very popular in the Western nations including
here in the United States and in Hollywood. It is probably the most
acceptable and popular of the Eastern religions. Yoga which is also seen
in Hinduism has taken over here in the US with it even being pushed by
Christians. This teaching is dangerous as it opens the door for Satan. God
does not want our minds emptied, but rather to fill them with the Spirit
and for us to meditate upon his word. Hollywood has been pushing Buddhism
for a long time though in hidden ways including yoga. George Lucas who
created the Star Wars movies is a Buddhist and said he wrote the movies to
push Buddhism on the United States, especially to the youth.   

Buddhism does not have a holy book such as Christianity has the Holy
Bible or Islam has the Koran. There are many writings in Buddhism with the
most popular being a large collection of writings known as the Pali Canon
which is divided into three parts. There is no god in Buddhism, but the
writings of Buddha guide Buddhists.

All Buddhists believe in the three jewels known as the yellow jewel
(Buddha), the teachings or the blue jewel, and the monastic order or the
red jewel. Buddhist monks chant these three jewels every day. Buddhists
also believe in what are referred to as The Four Noble Truths. They are
Dukkha or suffering, Samudaya or craving, Nirodha or cease, and Marga or
cessation of suffering. Buddhists follow the Eightfold Path which includes
the Four Noble Truths. These eight steps are broken into three main areas
of Training in Wisdom, Training in Morality, and Training in
Concentration. These eight steps are to remove the Buddhist from the
world, eliminate all distractions, understand themselves, and purge
improper thoughts. While removing sinful thoughts is admirable, Jesus said
that we as Christians are to live in the world, just not be a part of it.
We are not to run off to monasteries or avoid the world the way Buddhists
do. I will say the Buddhists do not have a reputation for attacking
Christians the way Muslims and Hindus do which is good. Buddhists do try
to be peaceful as a whole. The Middle Way is the Buddhist belief that
consists of the Eightfold Path and other Buddha teachings. Together this
is known as the Dharma which means religious duties. The goal of every
Buddhist is to end suffering. The only way that will happen is to receive
Jesus as their Saviour. They will not know what suffering is until in
hell.

Several terms are well known by most Westerners. Buddhists believe in
karma which is basically you reap what you sow. They believe that all
their actions they do whether good or bad affects their life not only now
but future lives. They believe past lives also affects how they are today
based on their karma and each life builds on the karma of previous lives.

Another well-known term is reincarnation (Samsara) which is the
belief that a Buddhist will continue to be born and die and then be born
again and die and will continue this cycle until the Buddhist reaches the
point that they can break the cycle. A Buddhist can return as a person or
animal. Transmigration of the soul goes along with this belief in that the
soul of the person goes into the new body each time. Understand that when
talking to a Buddhist about being "born again" they will understand this
term in a completely different way. A Buddhist does not believe in a
permanent soul. They believe once a Buddhist reaches nirvana that it is
destroyed. God says we die once. (Hebrews 9:27 And as it is appointed unto
men once to die, but after this the judgment:) 

Nirvana varies among Buddhists but is when a Buddhist eliminates
greed, hatred, ignorance, and delusion. Some Buddhists believe nirvana is
the state of ultimate bliss or happiness. Other Buddhists believe it is
the point when a Buddhist is able to end the cycle of reincarnation and
the soul is liberated and extinguished or annihilated. Buddhists believe
that all castes can reach nirvana and are equal. Castes are the divisions
of people by wealth and rank and social status. This is big in India with
those born in low castes greatly despised by the upper castes in Hinduism.
It is believed the low castes are their because of their karma.

When it comes to creation, the Buddhist has no answer as they do not
care how all suffering got here, only that it be stopped. They do not
believe in a supreme being and Buddha never addressed creation. When it
comes to heaven and hell the Buddhist does not believe in any kind of
afterlife, but rather hopes that there is no afterlife and they can
achieve this end by reaching nirvana. A few Buddhists do believe a small
amount of Buddhists will go to a fiery hell and be punished similar to the
Roman Catholic purgatory for a while and then be put back on the cycle of
birth, death, and reincarnation to try once again to reach nirvana.

Most Buddhists believe that Buddha had a miraculous birth so they
have no problem believing Jesus did as well. Buddhists do not believe
Jesus is God, but they do believe he was a great teacher and taught great
social issues. Many Buddhists admire his teachings. Buddhists admire how
he helped the poor and believe Jesus postponed nirvana for himself by
caring more for others than himself. He is greatly respected for this.
Some Buddhists who have read the Holy Bible say that Jesus was a Buddha.
The one difference between Jesus and Buddha and other founders of
religions such as Mohammed with Islam is that they are all dead whereas
Jesus is alive and well. Christians serve a living God.  

Many professing Christians believe Buddhism is compatible with
Christianity and say they are Catholic Buddhists or they are Methodist
Buddhists. These two religions are not compatible. Buddhism will only lead
to death whereas true Christianity is a personal relationship with Jesus
Christ and will lead to everlasting life. (John 3:16 ¶ For God so loved
the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have everlasting life.) Buddhism denies God and
the deity of Jesus and is about one's self whereas Christianity is about
others. Buddhism is darkness and true Christianity is light and we are not
to be yoked with darkness, but to come out of the darkness. (I John 1:5-7
This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you,
that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we
lie, and do not the truth:
7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship
one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from
all sin.) (Ephesians 5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works
of darkness, but rather reprove them.) (II Corinthians 6:14 Be ye not
unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath
righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with
darkness?)

Most Buddhists are vegetarians as they do not believe in harming
animals. We are commanded to be kind to animals, but God gave us animals
to eat if they are blessed with prayer. (Genesis 9:3 Every moving thing
that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you
all things.) (I Timothy 4:4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing
to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:) Buddhist monks keep
their heads shaved and often beg for food.  

For any precious Buddhist soul that may be listening, I plead with
you that you will turn from the false religion of Buddhism and turn to a
personal relationship with Jesus. Admit that you are a sinner on a path to
hell and need a Saviour to save you. That Saviour is Jesus. No works or
anything you do will save you, only Jesus. Call upon Jesus now to save you
and see what being free is all about.
