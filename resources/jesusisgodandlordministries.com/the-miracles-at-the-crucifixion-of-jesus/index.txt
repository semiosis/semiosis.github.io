The Miracles at the Crucifixion of Jesus

Five miracles will be seen that happened at the crucifixion of Jesus
until his resurrection.

1. The first miracle was the darkness on the whole earth.

Matthew 27:45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
unto the ninth hour.

Mark 15:33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the
whole land until the ninth hour.

(Luke 23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over
all the earth until the ninth hour.  

Luke 23:45a And the sun was darkened,)

Many people try to say this was an eclipse of the sun to deny this
miracle and that it was confined only to area around Jerusalem and Judea.
They are wrong on both accounts. Passover always occurred during a full
moon. A solar eclipse can only occur during a new moon. No astronomical
records of the time mention a solar eclipse. Scripture also says the
darkness lasted for three hours from the sixth hour to the ninth hour
which is from noon to 3 pm. The longest ever recorded total solar eclipse
is only about seven minutes, nowhere near three hours as occurred here and
it did not darken the whole earth, nor do any solar eclipses.     

Luke 23:44 clearly tells us this supernatural darkness covered the whole
earth.

Two Greek historians from that time wrote of the worldwide darkness.
Both of these men were pagans, so were not recording it to try and defend
scripture. The first was Thallus who was alive at the time of the
crucifixion, wrote in his book Third History around A.D. 52, "that
darkness totally covered the land at the time of the passover". In another
place he says "On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness".
The second Greek was Phlegon who lived near Ephesus. He wrote in his
Collection of Olympiads and Chronicles, "At the sixth hour the day was
turned into dark night, so that the stars in the heavens were seen".
Notice he not only mentions the darkness, but even starting the same sixth
hour as recorded in scripture. The Romans also recorded this as they were
known for recorded events in their empire. One Roman historian wrote "At
the same time at noonday there was a great darkness." Roman archives could
be studied by the public.

Amos prophesied of this darkness in about 750 B.C.

Amos 8:9-10 9 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD,
that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth
in the clear day:
10 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into
lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness
upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and
the end thereof as a bitter day.

It can be clearly seen that there was a supernatural darkness over
the whole earth from the sixth hour to the ninth hour. This was no
ordinary darkness, but as one historian said a great and fearful darkness.
The reason as stated could not be from an eclipse. Jesus is the light of
the world. (John 8:12, John 9:5, Revelation 21:23 et cetera) Jesus was on
the cross from the third to the ninth hours (9 am to 3 pm). For the final
three hours, God the Father could not look upon his Son Jesus as Jesus
bore the sins of the whole world for all who will ever live. Jesus was
dying and he is the light of the world. There was darkness for the last
three hours of Jesus' crucifixion since it was at this point he took on
the sins of the whole world. Sin always brings in darkness. No light in
sin. This was the first time Jesus cried out as the pain of carrying sin
far outweighed his physical pain from the crucifixion. Also at this time
God the Father and God the Holy Ghost had to forsake Jesus as he took on
the sins of the world. This hurt Jesus more than anything else. All of
creation mourned for his death, except man who prefers darkness. (John
3:19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.).
Mankind got the darkness they wanted.

2. Jesus gave up the ghost

Matthew 27:50 ¶ Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded
up the ghost.

Mark 15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?

Mark 15:37  And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

Luke 23:46 ¶ And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the
ghost.

John 19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.

Jesus gave up the ghost and died. He himself gave his life for you
and me and the world. No man took it. No person can will themselves to
death at a precise moment, even when one commits suicide. He died
precisely at the ninth hour (3 pm) to obey the law, for this was the time
of the sacrifice of the passover lambs. (I Corinthians 5:7 Purge out
therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened.
For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:) Jesus chose the time
of his death. He cried out with a loud voice just before he died,
something no ordinary person would have been able to due under his
condition. This shows he should have been able to live awhile longer, but
he chose this specific time for his death. God, not man was in control.

The Roman centurion recognized the miracle in how Jesus determined
the time of his death, not them.

Mark 15:39 ¶ And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw
that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was
the Son of God.

The Christian historian Tertullian who lived from 160-220 wrote "At
his own free-will, he with a word dismissed from his spirit, anticipating
the executioner's work."

3. Veil of the temple torn.

Matthew 27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from
the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;

Mark 15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
the bottom.

Luke 23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent
in the midst.

At the time that Jesus gave up the ghost (died), the veil of the
temple was torn into two pieces in the middle of it from top to bottom.
The veil separated the holy of holies from the rest of the temple and was
to be accessed only by the high priest once a year on the day of
atonement. (Exodus 30:10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns
of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements:
once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your
generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.) (Hebrews 9:7 But into the
second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood,
which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:) At the
time it was torn (ninth hour or 3 pm), this was the exact hour that the
Jews would sacrifice their passover lambs. The veil was torn from top to
bottom as it was done by God and showed access to him was now not just for
the high priest once a year, but for all believers at any time day or
night any day of the year through his Son Jesus. All true Christians are
priests. This also was an indication that animal sacrifices were no longer
needed as the ultimate sacrifice in Jesus as our passover lamb was
complete.  The veil was a reminder that we as sinners were to remain
separate from God, but now we as sinners through the blood of Jesus could
have direct access to God.

The veil was according to Jewish tradition four inches thick and was
at least 30 feet tall. Supposedly it was so strong and heavy, that even a
team of horses could not rip it. It was nothing for God to tear it in
half.

4. Earthquake at the time of the death of Jesus.

When Jesus died on the cross for you and me and all mankind, there
was a great earthquake. It should be noted that Jesus gave up his life and
died for us and that no one took it from him.

Matthew 27: 51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from
the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;

The whole earth shook at the fact that the Creator of the universe
was dead and it was its way of showing mourning. If only all of man felt
the same way. Some Romans did get saved that day by the events on the
cross as seen in Matthew 27:54.

Matthew 27:54  Now when the centurion, and they that were with him,
watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they
feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

The earthquake at the crucifixion is also mentioned by the Greek
Thallus when he said "the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many
places in Judea and other distrcts were thrown down." The Greek Phlegon
also mentons the earthquake. He said "there was an earthquake in Bithynia
which overthrew many houses in the city of Nice (Nicea)." I believe even
as was recorded by these men that this was a worldwide quake and not just
a local event, just as the darkness was worldwide. Jesus and his death
effected all people of the earth and not just the Jews in Judea or
Jerusalem. The earthquake was to show the power of God and how they had
crucified God the Creator himself, but that he stills lives and is in
power and control.

When the earth shook, it opened up graves and rent rocks. The amateur
archeologist Ron Wyatt, a humble Christian who had asked God to allow him
to find things from scripture that would help him win souls for Jesus and
not just find things for himself to get glory, said he found the ark of
the covenant buried in a tunnel under the cross of Jesus. It was most
likely put there by Jeremiah. According to Ron Wyatt, he found evidence of
the earthquake at the crucifixion site as mentioned in scripture. He said
the rocks below the cross of Jesus were rent in pieces. There was also a
crack in the ground under the cross where blood had seeped in the ground.
He found that the blood of Jesus had gone through this crack in the ground
and dripped into the mercy seat of the ark of the covenant showing Jesus
again fulfilled the law. As our passover lamb, and the ultimate sin
offering to cover all the sins of man, not his, his blood was placed on
the mercy seat just as the high priest would place the blood of the sin
offering on the mercy seat on the day of atonement. Just like our Saviour
to do this and again show he is who he says he is and is God. Jesus would
later place his blood on the heavenly mercy seat as the final sacrifice
was made once and for all.

5. The graves were opened up.

Matthew 27:52  52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the
saints which slept arose,
53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the
holy city, and appeared unto many.

Notice that God opened the graves of certain saints. He did not open
all graves, but some of his children in Jerusalem as another witness
against the Jews. Notice that only saved people were brought back to life.
God never returns unsaved people from hell. Hell is a final solution for
all who reject Jesus as their Saviour except when they get cast into the
lake of fire. These saints graves were opened on the day of the
crucifixion, but the bodies did not come out of the graves until after the
resurrection of Jesus on Sunday morning. Even here again Jesus obeyed the
law and did not present the saints to their families before Sunday or the
Jews would have been unclean for the passover and sabbath. Jesus is the
first fruits of resurrection. Jesus had to rise first before anyone else
could including those whose graves were opened. (I Corinthians 15:20 But
now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that
slept.) (I Corinthians 15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the
firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.)  

All of these miracles were done to show Jesus is God and as final
signs to the Jews that Jesus was their Messiah. The Jews would be given 50
days after the resurrection of Jesus to think about what they had seen on
the cross and repent and call upon Jesus when Peter spoke on Pentecost.

Many miracles were done by Jesus just before his crucifixion, during
the crucifixion and in the days after until his resurrection and even
after that. Some examples are Jesus healed the ear of Malchus cut off by
Peter at the time of the arrest of Jesus. Another is how the grave clothes
were left in the tomb just as they had been on Jesus and the napkin had
been folded. The ultimate miracle of course was the resurrection of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ on that third day, which allows us eternal
life with Jesus for those who will repent and call upon his name. His
resurrection was the defeat of Satan and shows he is God. Only God could
raise himself from the dead. Let us not be like most of the Jews of that
day, but let us receive Jesus as the Roman centurion did, the penitent
thief on the cross, and some Jews.
