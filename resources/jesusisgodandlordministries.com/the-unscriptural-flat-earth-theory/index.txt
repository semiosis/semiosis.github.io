The Unscriptural Flat Earth Theory

The false flat earth theory is making a comeback today including
among some professing Christians. I have spoken with some professing
Christians who believe this false theory. Many ancient heathen taught
this. The modern flat earth theory was founded by John William Draper and
Andrew Dickson White in the 1800's, but really began to pick up steam in
the 1950's. This theory is completely unscriptural and is dangerous
thinking as if you do not believe what scripture says as well as what can
be clearly observed by our eyes then how can you believe what is in
scripture that we cannot see? The flat earthers do not all agree on
everything, but there are some basics to the theory. Most believe the
earth is a flat disc while others believe it is a flat square. Most
believe that the earth does not move (rotate or revolve) and that the sun
and moon are only 3,000 miles away and revolve in circles in the sky with
stars at 3,100 miles away. They say this revolving in circles is why we
have daylight and nighttime as the light only hits certain spots on earth
at a time. It has long been proven that except the moon, the planets
revolve around the sun including the earth and that many planets have
their own satellites that revolve around them. Some believe the sun and
moon are spheres, but deny the earth is one. Some believe in an invisible
antimoon that must exist to create lunar eclipses. They deny we ever
landed on the moon. Many deny gravity saying it is only an illusion yet I
bet if I dropped a hammer above their head they would. Many of those say
the earth moves up rather than the object falls. There are many flat
earthers who believe the earth and the stars are all just in some giant
snow globe with the stars hanging from the top. Many believe the earth is
held up by four pillars. This idea is even mentioned in the Roman Catholic
bible the Christian Community Bible. Some change firmament to vault or
dome or something else to try and support this false belief. They say that
the windows in heaven that opened up at the time of the Genesis flood
refer to the top of this globe which is supposedly surrounded by water
being opened up to allow some of this water in. They say the firmament in
scripture refers to this dome. They say the sky looks blue because you can
see the waters outside the dome. Some flat earthers believe the arctic
circle is in the center of the earth with Antarctica being a wall of ice
150 feet tall that surrounds the earth's edge and say NASA has people
there to keep people from falling off. They believe all NASA or other
space agencies such as those on Japan, China, or Europe are all in the lie
to continue to promote a round earth and the pictures are a fake. None
believe that man has ever been to space. Most flat earthers believe in the
false global warming with much of the data coming from NASA yet they deny
NASA when it comes to proof that the earth is a sphere. Some flat earthers
believe the earth is diamond shape. Many believe all world governments are
hiding the truth about a flat earth and among professing Christian
believers they say this is to deny God and mock scripture yet they are the
ones making a mockery of God and scripture and denying commonsense.
Professing Christian believers say the missile tests being done are ways
for Satan to try and find a way to get back out of the dome and back to
heaven since he was kicked out and sent here by God. Scripture shows that
for now Satan does still have access to heaven though one day he no longer
will. We see in Job how Satan as one of the sons of God came before God
twice and that is when God gave Satan permission to test Job. Sons of God
in Job refers to angels of which Satan is one. The verses in Job clearly
show that Satan is not trapped inside the supposed dome. (Job 1:6 ¶ Now
there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the
LORD, and Satan came also among them.) There are many other crazy beliefs
among the flat earth believers.  

When Christopher Columbus left Spain to find India and landed in
North America instead, he had faced much criticism by those who believed
Christopher would sail off the edge of the earth. Most people then
believed in a flat earth which was taught by the Roman Catholic Church.
The question is if the ship could fall off then why does the water not
fall off? Christopher was a man who believed God's word that the earth was
round so he did not fear falling off. Scripture tells us the earth is
round. (Isaiah 40:22 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth,
and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the
heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:)
Notice Isaiah says the circle of the earth showing it is round. Why would
the sun and moon be spheres, but the earth flat? This verse also says God
stretcheth out the heavens showing that the sun, planets, and stars are
not nearby and the earth is not inside a giant snow globe. Other verses
also speak of God stretching out the heavens. Here are a couple more
verses. (Psalm 104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment:
who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:) (Job 9:8 Which alone
spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.) One
way to clearly see the earth is a sphere or globe and not flat is to watch
ships leave a port in the ocean. As the ships leave they will eventually
start to disappear at the bottom and then finally the top. If you have
multiple ships in view, the farthest ones away will only show the top of
the ship with the closer ones the whole ship. This effect is caused by the
ships going below the horizon proving the earth is a globe. This can also
be seen while flying in an airplane where you can look down on the ground
and actually see the curvature of the earth. The earth's dimension was
first measured by a Greek in the 200 BC's and he measured the length of a
shadow in two locations that was known how far away they were. The fact
that shadow lengths vary by location shows the earth is a sphere. Round
tires are compared to the moon showing the moon is round. (Isaiah 3:18 In
that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments
about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,)
Many stars can only be seen in either the northern or southern hemisphere.
If the earth were flat then you would not see certain stars in only
certain locations, but they would be visible everywhere.  

Many flat earthers say the earth has four corners proving it is a
flat earth as told in Revelation 7:1. (Revelation 7:1 And after these
things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth,
holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the
earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.) This verse is not speaking of
four literal corners, but rather the north, south, east, and west winds.
Often times people speak metaphorically such as I am so hungry I could eat
a horse yet even if you had not eaten for a week then you could not eat a
whole horse. Everyone knows that the person is speaking figuratively that
he is just very hungry and the same is with this verse that is just
referring to the four cardinal directions and not four literal corners on
the earth. A sphere does not have corners as we saw in Isaiah. Revelation
20:8 is another verse they often use to support their false belief.
(Revelation 20:8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the
four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to
battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.) Many modern bibles
change quarters to corners so they like to quote from them. All this verse
means is that Satan would go to every place on earth where man is living
and will deceive them. It again has nothing to do with a flat earth.   

Some flat earthers say that Genesis 13:17 speaks of a flat earth.
(Genesis 13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.) This verse has to do with
the Promised Land that God gave to Abraham and walking through it. The
verse speaks of a breadth and a length, but all it means is that it has a
certain area that can be measured. Any plot of land would be the same. If
you have a one acre plot of land you can walk the length of it as well as
the width, but this has nothing to do with a flat earth. Other verses that
speak of breadth are also used by them such as Job 38:18 which again is
speaking of how the earth has a width which we know as the circumference.
Even a sphere such as the earth has an "edge" before circling on. When we
measure our waist we just go from edge to edge even though it is round and
the same applies in this verse. Psalm 104:5 is another verse used by flat
earthers who say the earth does not move just like they say it does not
and it just sits in this snow globe dome. (Psalm 104:5 Who laid the
foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.) This
verse does not imply any such false belief. This verse says the
foundations of the earth should not be moved. Jesus as the Creator has
made the earth so that no one can destroy it unless he does as he will one
day by fire. (II Peter 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief
in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the
works that are therein shall be burned up.) It just means the earth is a
firm foundation, but it does move as seen in earthquakes. This verse has
nothing to do with the earth rotating on its axis or revolving around the
sun where it does move all the time. Part of the problem with many of the
professing Christians who believe in a flat earth is they do not use a
King James Bible. Modern bibles often change Psalm 104:5 to say fixed the
earth on its foundation and cannot be shaken. These changes support the
flat earth theory and this is yet another reason to stick with the
inspired King James Bible. The King James Bibles in this verse says laid
the foundation not fixed which is much more accurate as I already said how
the earth does move and is not in a fixed spot and we also have
earthquakes. They also use Psalm 93:1 to try and say the earth does not
move. (Psalm 93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD
is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also
is stablished, that it cannot be moved.) This verse just means that again
Satan cannot destroy this earth as it has been established by God.      

Flat earth believers believe the earth is set upon four pillars which
hold up the flat earth. They say I Samuel 2:8 speaks of these pillars. (I
Samuel 2:8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the
beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them
inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S,
and he hath set the world upon them.) This verse is not speaking of
literal pillars holding up the earth. This verse and the verses around it
are speaking of how God is in control of every situation and also how he
gives security to his saints. God uses the pillars to show how it is he
who holds up the earth and we do not need to worry about anything. Job
26:7 shows us how the earth hangs upon nothing which includes it is not
supported by pillars. Flat earthers also often use Psalm 75:3 to try and
support their false view.

There are also various verses that speak of the "ends of the earth"
and flat earthers say this shows the earth is flat as a flat object has
ends, but a globe does not. If you look at the different verses then in
every case it is just referring to God can see the whole earth or we are
to preach the gospel to every person on earth no matter where they live.
In every case it is just referring to the whole earth and never that it
has literally an end that we could fall off of.  

Some flat earthers say the moon is only a light as shadows can be
seen on it or some even say it is just a projection. God says that he
created it on day four as the lesser light. (Genesis 1:16 And God made two
great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to
rule the night: he made the stars also.)

Belief in the flat earth theory leads to denial of what God's word
says about his creation. If you cannot believe what he says about his
creation then how can you believe what he says about a person's need for
salvation? A professing Christian who believes in a flat earth will never
grow but will always stay a milk Christian assuming they are a true
Christian as Genesis 1-11 is the foundation for John 3:16. Jesus spoke of
a time when even the very elect could be deceived if he let it happen.
(Matthew 24:24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets,
and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were
possible, they shall deceive the very elect.) I believe here is a case
showing people being deceived by believing in a flat earth contrary to
what the word of God teaches.
