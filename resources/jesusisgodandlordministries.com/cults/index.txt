CULTS

A cult is a supposedly Christian denomination that denies or changes the
main beliefs of Christianity. All cults are false Christianity and
dangerous as they deceive their people and are ultimately sending them on
a path to an eternity in hell and the lake of fire. All cults are from
Satan, not God. Below is just a few of the bigger ones and is by no means
a complete list of every cult. Most people never recognize the two biggest
cults in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy while others are
recognized by most professing Christians. The difference between a cult
and a false religion is that cults claim to be Christians whereas false
religions do not. False religions are based off other gods and not Jesus
even though cults have a false Jesus than the Jesus of scripture. Some
false religions are Islam. Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, and there are
others.
