The Widow Woman and the Oil  

Today is Mother's day and I want to look at one woman in scripture
who trusted in the Lord and was faithful. The story of this woman can be
found in II Kings 4:1-7. This woman was a widow who had been married to a
son of the prophets. When a woman became a widow in biblical days, then
this became a real hardship. Unlike today when widows can get assistance
from the government or other sources, this was not the case for this
woman. Women in those days did not work, but stayed at home and raised the
children. They had no skills and would not have been as educated as the
men so that if the husband died then they had no means of income. There
were no life insurance benefits, social security, or other government
aids. God did require the people to leave some of the crops and oil for
widows and the fatherless. (Deuteronomy 24:19-21 19 ¶ When thou cuttest
down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field,
thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the
fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all
the work of thine hands.
20 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs
again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the
widow.
21 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not
glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and
for the widow.) This would help with some food, but not with money.
(Deuteronomy 26:12 ¶ When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes
of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast
given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow,
that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;) Widows were often in
the same category as the fatherless in scripture since they both were in
the same boat and often times the widow had to now raise the children
without a dad. Widows in those days were expected to be supported by their
relatives, but many relatives refused their duty to take care of widows
and maybe even more at this time since so many of the people had turned
from God and did not obey his commandments. God reminded of this in the
New Testament as well and told the church to help take care of them. (I
Timothy 5:4 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn
first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is
good and acceptable before God.) This widow lived in Israel which had
become a very idolatrous nation as most of the people had turned from the
true God Jehovah to the false god Baal. We are not even told the name of
the widow in this story as women were often times not seen as important,
but God knows her name and she was important to him and he provided for
her because she trusted in him. God also may have not given a name as he
wants us to remember his glory that was done and not give any to the
woman.    

Let us look at this widow woman. (II Kings 4:1-7 1 Now there cried a
certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha,
saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant
did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons
to be bondmen.
2 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast
thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the
house, save a pot of oil.
3 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
4 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon
thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set
aside that which is full.
5 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who
brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.
6 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her
son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel
more. And the oil stayed.
7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil,
and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.)

We see in verse 1 how this widow woman cried out to Elisha the
prophet. Remember she had been married to a son of the prophets and the
verse ending seems to imply that Elisha had known her husband. The widow
cries out to Elisha and says you know that my husband or servant had
feared the LORD and yet the creditors have come to take my two sons as
bondmen or slaves. We are not told how old her sons were, but no mom wants
her sons to become slaves because of debt owed by their parents and
especially because it was most likely incurred because the husband died
and no income was coming in, yet the bills did not stop. This widow's
husband was one of the few in Israel that did fear the LORD as most had
cursed him and turned to Baal. This widow could not just declare
bankruptcy like so many do today. God expects people to pay their debts
and that includes his servants such as this widow's husband had been. Just
because someone has served the Lord faithfully, does not exempt them from
paying their debts. (Psalm 37:21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not
again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.) In those days if a
widow could not pay her debts then the sons were taken and used as slave
labor to repay the debt. They would remain slaves until the debt was
repaid. This widow knew that Elisha was a man of God and that God would
hear his prayer and answer it.  

In verse 2 we see Elisha asks the widow what it was that she expected
him to do. He then asks her what she had in the house. This was most
likely done to see what she had that could be sold. The widow said that
all she had was a pot of oil. This was most likely olive oil which was
used for cooking and other purposes such as lighting lamps. Elisha wanted
to see what she had first before calling on God. Often times we have the
things we need already in our house that God has previously given us and
yet we overlook them expecting God to do some miracle or bail us out. God
would do a miracle for this widow, but he used what was already in her
house.

In verse 3 we see Elisha then tells her to go to her neighbors and
borrow as many empty vessels as she can and do not be lazy and only grab a
few. She was to get as many from the neighbors as they would let her
borrow. This widow did as she was asked. She fully trusted in God and what
God would have Elisha do. She did not question him or say what good will
that do me. This is unlike Naaman, whose story is found in II Kings 5, who
would later come to Elisha to be cleansed of leprosy and was ready to
ignore the words of Elisha after he was told to go and dip in the Jordan
River seven times when he wanted him to do something more. He thought that
was too simple. He finally was convinced by his servants to obey and was
healed, but he questioned the tactics of Elisha at first. The widow woman
never did. She did not expect some great miracle or something more than
getting empty vessels. The widow gathered as many empty vessels as she
could. This would be important as we will soon see.

In verse 4 we see Elisha commands the widow to bring all of the empty
vessels that she had borrowed and to bring them into her house and then to
shut the door. She was then to empty the pot of oil into a vessel and when
it was full to then set it aside. She was to keep doing this until all of
the pots were full. Here again the widow trusted in God enough to know
that he would use his prophet Elisha to perform his miracle. She never
said how ridiculous is that knowing that there was not enough oil in the
pot to fill all of the vessels. She just did what she was told to do. Let
this be a lesson to all of us that when God speaks through a man then let
us listen to what he says and then do it without questioning. We need to
have enough faith to believe and trust in God. It would have been
pointless for this widow woman to have cried out to Elisha for help and
then to ignore what he told her to do, yet many people do just that as
they cry out to God and then ignore what he tells them in scripture or
from another godly person.

Verse 5 shows the woman obeying Elisha by having brought the vessels
into her house and shutting the door. She then has her sons bring her the
vessels as she pours the oil into them and then they set aside the full
ones.

In verse 6 we see the woman asks one of her sons to bring her yet
another vessel to be filled and placed along the many other full vessels.
The son tells her that there are no more vessels to fill. Since there were
no more vessels to fill then the oil stayed or stopped. Notice though that
the oil never ran out. If they had had more vessels to fill then the oil
would have continued to fill them up as well. This miracle is like when
Jesus fed the five thousand with five loaves of bread and two fishes and
yet he ended up with more than he started with even after all of those men
ate.

In verse 7 we see the woman came to Elisha after she had finished
filling all of the vessels with oil and told him how she had done as he
had commanded. It is important to always go back to God or in this case
she went to Elisha who was being used by God. Elisha then told her to go
and sell the oil and use the money to pay off her debts so that her sons
would not be taken as bondmen and then the woman was to use the rest of
the money for her and her children to live off of. This is probably why
Elisha told the woman to shut the door so that no one could see all of the
oil she had and try and steal it from her. Even this simple act of
obedience in fully doing what she was told to do was significant so that
she would have the oil to sell. God also may have done this as he often
does his miracles behind the scenes as they are not for the heathen as
most Israelites were, but only for those like this woman who trusted in
him. God never forgot this widow woman who trusted in him. He provided for
her when no one else did and cared for her when all hope seemed gone. That
is when God does his best work, but he does require us to trust in him and
place our faith in him. We saw how God used what was already in her house.
She did not have to get oil from somewhere else along with vessels and
then have God multiply the oil. She already had the oil. The same applies
to each of us who places our trust in God as God has already supplied us
with something that he can use for his honor and glory. We just need to
trust him and let him do his work with what he has already given us. The
problem is most do not trust God enough to do as he says he would. If this
woman had refused to obey Elisha then she would have lost her sons as
bondmen and most likely would have died herself from starvation. The same
also applies to if she had not obeyed Elisha by borrowing as many vessels
as she could. So many people want to just do as little as they can. One
example is seen when the Israelite king Joash came to Elisha just before
Elisha died and asked for his help in defeating the Syrians. Elisha told
him to strike arrows upon the ground as these arrows represented
deliverance by God from Syria. The king only struck the ground three times
and then stopped. He should have kept striking the ground until Elisha
told him to stop. Elisha scolded him for stopping and said he would defeat
Syria three times, but that if he had struck the ground five or six times
instead of stopping then he could have consumed Syria. This king should
have wanted to completely defeat Syria, but he was too lazy to strike the
arrows more than three times even when he was told it represented God's
deliverance. This man never truly trusted that God could deliver Israel or
he would have done more. Fortunately this widow woman was not like this
heathen king. The story of the king and Elisha can be found in II Kings
13:14-19. This should be a lesson for us not to stop what God tells us to
do until he tells us to stop. If she had not borrowed enough vessels then
she would not have been able to pay off her debt and still have enough
money to live on. Notice that because of her obedience then God not only
took care of her immediate need in paying off her debt and keeping her
sons from becoming bondmen, but he also provided for her long term needs
by making sure she had money for the rest of her life to live on and to
also provide for her children. God is not skimpy with those who fully
trust in him. God provides for all time, unlike people who only usually
are concerned about immediate needs.  

God used this widow woman who placed her faith and trust in him to
perform a miracle. This woman was wise enough to know to cry out to Elisha
who was a man of God and not go to one of the prophets of Baal as she knew
they could not help her nor would they even care about her. May more moms
be like this woman who loved her sons enough that she was willing to call
out to a man of God for help and more importantly was willing to listen
and do what he told her to do. If you are not saved then what better give
can you give your mom on this Mother's Day than to admit that you are a
sinner in need of a Saviour and call upon Jesus to save you.
