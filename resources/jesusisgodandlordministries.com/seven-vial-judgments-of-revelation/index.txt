Seven Vial Judgments of Revelation

Revelation speaks of seven vial judgments from God during the
tribulation. The vial judgments are the final seven judgments of twenty
one judgments by God during the tribulation. They follow the seven seal
judgments and the seven trumpet judgments. The vial judgments are
incorrectly referred to as bowl judgments in the corrupt modern bibles.
The tribulation is the seven year period just before the return of Jesus
in his second coming. The tribulation is the time of punishment to bring
the Jews to Jesus and punish the Gentile nations for their treatment of
his chosen people. Only one third of the Jews will survive the tribulation
and they will finally recognize Jesus is their Messiah. (Zechariah 13:8-9
8 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two
parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left
therein.
9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them
as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call
on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they
shall say, The LORD is my God.) The vial judgments follow the seal
judgments and the trumpet judgments. During the tribulation God will bring
his wrath upon the earth and much of the world's population will be
destroyed.

Some of the vial judgments are similar to the trumpet judgments, but
on a much grander scale. The first vial judgment will bring noisome
(hurtful and destructive) and grievous sores upon all the men who have
taken the mark of the beast. (Revelation 16:1-2 1 And I heard a great
voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour
out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
2 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there
fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the
beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.) This is a direct
judgment by God on all those who willingly have chosen to serve Satan
rather than God by taking the mark of the beast and by worshipping the
beast. God is showing in these judgments that he is greater than Satan and
he alone is in control. Any people who have gotten saved during the
tribulation will not be affected by this vial judgment. This is similar to
the judgments by God on Egypt during the ten plagues given by God to
Moses. A direct sore given by God will be much worse than any ever given
by man.

The second vial judgment will cause the sea to turn into blood and
will kill all life living in it. (Revelation 16:3 And the second angel
poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a
dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.) This will be a severe
judgment as much of man's food comes from the sea as well as much commerce
is done by travel on the sea. The ecological disaster from all of the dead
animals and any people killed at this time will be tremendous. Dead
animals and people will be all over the shores and the smell will be
tremendous and noxious as decaying flesh begins. Many diseases will most
likely start. This second vial judgment compares to the second trumpet
judgment, but on a much grander scale. The second trumpet judgment will
cause a third part of the sea to turn into blood with a third of life
destroyed including ships, but the second vial judgment will turn all of
the sea into blood and destroy all life. (Revelation 8:8-9 8 And the
second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire
was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
9 And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life,
died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.)

The third vial judgment will cause the rivers and fresh water to turn
into blood. This is a major disaster as man needs fresh water to live.
Jesus as the living water is rejected by the people of the world and
therefore God is giving them what they want and deserve. They have
rejected the living water, therefore God has given them dead water. This
judgment will also bring an ecological disaster. Think how hard it is
today to bring fresh water to victims following floods or hurricanes. Here
the water is blood and undrinkable. (John 7:38
He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water.) (Revelation 16:4-7 4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon
the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord,
which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.
6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given
them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
7 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty,
true and righteous are thy judgments.) The third trumpet judgment is
similar to the third vial judgment, but again the vial judgment is much
grander. The trumpet judgment destroys a third part of the rivers, but the
vial judgment all of it. (Revelation 8:10-11 10 And the third angel
sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a
lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the
fountains of waters;
11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the
waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were
made bitter.) Turning the rivers into blood is a reminder of the first
plague against the Egyptians when the rivers where turned into blood by
Moses at the power of God. (Exodus 7:14-25)

The fourth vial judgment will cause the sun to produce great heat and
will scorch men. The sun represents a type of Jesus as Jesus is the light
of the world and Jesus is showing how powerful his light can be for those
who reject him. (John 8:12 ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them,
saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.)
(Revelation 16:8-9 8 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the
sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.
9 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God,
which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him
glory.) Notice how people instead of repenting of their sins and calling
on Jesus to save them and keep them from future judgments, instead
blasphemy the name of God. This shows how much these people have rejected
God and chosen Satan. We see some of this today. The fourth trumpet
judgment is similar to the fourth vial judgment in that both affect the
sun, though the trumpet judgment weakens the sun by having it not shine
for a third part of the day as well as the moon and stars not shine for a
third part of the night, whereas the vial judgment strengthens the sun.
Notice how the moon is affected here as well as the moon represents
Christians who are to reflect the light of Jesus just as the moon reflects
the light of the sun. There are not many saved people living at this time,
so there is not much light getting reflected. (Revelation 8:12-13 12 And
the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and
the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the
third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of
it, and the night likewise.
13 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven,
saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by
reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are
yet to sound!) The partial darkness of the fourth trumpet judgment is a
reminder of the darkness brought about in the ninth plague against the
Egyptians. (Exodus 10:21-23)

The fifth vial judgment will bring darkness upon the seat of the
beast, most likely Rome, and on his kingdom. This will be a darkness so
great that it will cause pain and agony. Rejection of the light of Jesus
will bring great pain and suffering and an everlasting eternity in
darkness in hell and the lake of fire. The darkness is symbolic of the
spiritual darkness of the world and her rejection of Jesus and his light.
The beast (antichrist) is also indwelt with Satan himself and his
darkness. This darkness and the gnawing pain it will cause is again
similar to the ninth plague against Egypt. (Revelation 16:10-11 10 And the
fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his
kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
11 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their
sores, and repented not of their deeds.) Notice how once again the people
blasphemed God rather than admit their sin has caused their pain. The
fifth trumpet judgment previously also brought darkness to the earth as
the bottomless pit was opened and evil creatures belonging to Satan were
released bringing their spiritual darkness to mankind. (Revelation 9:1-2 1
And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the
earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the
pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were
darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.)

The sixth vial judgment will dry up the Euphrates river in
preparation for the battle of Armageddon. Unclean spirits like frogs will
come out of the mouth of the dragon (Satan), the beast (antichrist), and
the false prophet. The dragon is Satan. (Revelation 12:9 And the great
dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which
deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels
were cast out with him.) The frogs that come out of the mouths of this
unholy Satanic trinity is a reminder of the second plague of Egypt and the
land being overrun by frogs whom they worshipped. (See Exodus 8:1-15)
(Revelation 16:12-16 12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the
great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of
the kings of the east might be prepared.
13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the
dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the
false prophet.
14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth
unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the
battle of that great day of God Almighty.
15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his
garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue
Armageddon.) The sixth trumpet judgment also deals with the Euphrates and
bringing death to man. The trumpet judgment will release the four angels
that are tied up and they will kill a third of the world population while
the vial judgment will help bring about the battle of Armegeddon which
will lead to much great bloodshed. (Revelation 9:13-15 And the sixth angel
sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which
is before God,
14 Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels
which are bound in the great river Euphrates.
15 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a
day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.)

The seventh and final vial judgment as well as the final judgment of
wrath poured upon people during the great tribulation will cause the
greatest earthquake to ever hit the earth. Jerusalem will be divided into
three parts and all of the world's cities will be destroyed and every
island will be gone. Imagine all of the great cities such as New York
City, Washington, D.C., London, Paris, Beijing, Tokyo, and all of the
other cities destroyed and gone. All of the islands will be gone including
the Hawaiian Islands, Great Britain, the Philippines, and all the rest.
This is all caused by this earthquake from God. Thunder, lightning and
large hail will also fall. The hail will weigh around 75-100 pounds (34-45
kilograms) depending on the source of how much a talent weighs. Even at
the low end, this hail will cause tremendous damage to anything hit by
them. (Revelation 16:17-21 17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial
into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven,
from the throne, saying, It is done.
18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a
great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty
an earthquake, and so great.
19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the
nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give
unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about
the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of
the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.) This seventh vial
judgment reminds us of the seventh plague of Egypt which brought thunder,
lightning, and hail upon Egypt. (Exodus 9:13-35) The seventh trumpet
judgment just as the seventh vial judgment brings an earthquake,
lightning, thunder, and great hail. God has a pattern in his judgments
from Egypt to the great tribulation. His wrath will be vindicated.
(Revelation 11:19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there
was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were
lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great
hail.)

The seven vial judgments will bring great death and destruction upon
this earth to all of those who have rejected Jesus and chosen Satan.
Choose Jesus today before it is too late and avoid the wrath of God and
his vial judgments. If you are not saved see What must I do to be saved
(be born again), have eternal life and go to heaven?
