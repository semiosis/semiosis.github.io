Alleged Contradictions in Scripture

Many people contend that there are contradictions in scripture. There
are no contradictions in scripture if you have the true word of God in a
King James Bible. What many people believe are contradictions are just
misinterpretation and misunderstanding of the passages or verses. If one
prays and asks the Holy Ghost to reveal the truth and if one looks
carefully at the verses in question and compares them with other scripture
and believes it is true what it says, it will be seen that often what we
think is a contradiction is just not understanding the verses.

One of the first alleged contradictions in scripture is the creation
story as presented in Genesis 1 versus Genesis 2. It appears it is two
different creation stories and that scripture is in error. One seems to
have the plants and animals created before man and the other created after
man. It also seems fowls (birds) where made of water in the first chapter
and out of the ground in the second chapter. A closer look shows there are
no contradictions. We see in Genesis 1 that the plants were made on day
three and the fowls on day four from the water and the land animals on day
six from the earth (ground) prior to the creation of man. (Genesis 1:11-13
And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and
the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself,
upon the earth: and it was so.
12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his
kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.
13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.) (Genesis 1:20-23
And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature
that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open
firmament of heaven.
21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,
which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every
winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the
waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.) (Genesis 1:24-25 ¶
And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his
kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind:
and it was so.
25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after
their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind:
and God saw that it was good.) (Genesis 1:26-28 ¶ And God said, Let us
make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth.
27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
him; male and female created he them.
28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth.) (Genesis 1:31 And God saw every thing
that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the
morning were the sixth day.) We now will look at the verses in chapter 2
of Genesis. (Genesis 2:8-9 ¶ And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in
Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is
pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.) (Genesis
2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field,
and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would
call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the
name thereof.) If you look carefully at these various verses from the
first two chapters, we see it is not a contradiction. In Genesis 1, God
created the plants on day three, the fowls from water on day five and the
land animals from the earth on day six before man. This covered the whole
earth. Genesis 2 speaks only of the creation in the garden of Eden where
God placed Adam. God created more plants for Adam to see that where
"pleasant to the sight, and good for food". Not every tree and plant was
recreated. Only those needed for food and pleasant to the sight. God also
created the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil at
this time. The animals where only the beasts of the field, not all animals
and the fowls where also made from out of the ground. These beasts and
fowls were not all of them on the earth, but just the ones God placed in
the garden of Eden so Adam could name each one. This is why these where
created after man and only these fowls were made out of the ground. God
also wanted Adam to see him create things so that he knew who the Creator
was knowing Satan later would try to claim to be God.

One alleged contradiction is if Noah was the eighth or tenth person
from Adam. If you read the chronology in Genesis 5, it clearly shows Noah
as the tenth person, but II Peter 2:5 seems to say the eighth. (II Peter
2:5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a
preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the
ungodly;) A closer look at this verse and those around it shows that this
verse is not talking about Noah's genealogy from Adam, but the eight
people saved on board the ark. Noah was the last person onboard the ark.
This verse is just taken out of context and compared with the wrong
scripture.

Another alleged contradiction is if one of the thieves on the cross
repented and was saved. Two gospels seem to say he did not and Luke seems
to say he did. (Matthew 27:44 The thieves also, which were crucified with
him, cast the same in his teeth.) (Mark 15:32 Let Christ the King of
Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they
that were crucified with him reviled him.) (Luke 23:39-40 ¶ And one of the
malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ,
save thyself and us.
40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God,
seeing thou art in the same condemnation?) Matthew and Mark show both
thieves railing against Jesus. Both thieves did originally do this, but
later as seen in Luke, one of the thieves repented and called upon Jesus
and was saved.

How many Isrealites died at Baal-peor? Numbers says 24,000 and I
Corinthians says 23,000. Which is it? (Numbers 25:9 And those that died in
the plague were twenty and four thousand.) (I Corinthians 10:8 Neither let
us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day
three and twenty thousand.) The answer is simple. 23,000 fell in one day
and a total of 24,000 over the total time of the plague.

What was the superscription above the cross of Jesus? Each gospel
reads differently. (Matthew 27:37 And set up over his head his accusation
written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.) (Mark 15:26 And the
superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.)
(Luke 23:38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.) (John 19:19 ¶
And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was,
JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.) Each gospel writer only gave a
part of the superscription. This is the same as witnesses do that see a
crime. Each person relates what they think is important. I also believe
the number of words in each gospel serves a purpose. The whole
superscription read "This is Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews."

Acts 20:35 seems to quote an unrecorded quote from Jesus. (Acts 20:35
I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support
the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is
more blessed to give than to receive.) This is only a problem to those who
are weak in the faith to think that everything Jesus said and did is in
the gospels. John even tells us they are not. (John 21:25 And there are
also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be
written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain
the books that should be written. Amen.)

I Corinthians 11 seems to say Jesus body was broken, but we are told
none of his bones were broken. (I Corinthians 11:23-24 For I have received
of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the
same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is
my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.) Other
verses say Jesus had no broken bones. (Psalm 34:20 He keepeth all his
bones: not one of them is broken.) (John 19:33 But when they came to
Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:) (John
19:36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled,
A bone of him shall not be broken.) A closer look at I Corinthians 11:24
shows it says the body of Jesus was broken, not his bones. The skin of
Jesus was broken, torn and hanging and all of his bones were out of joint.
This qualifies as a broken body, but still not having any broken bones.
(Psalm 22:14-15 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of
joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my
jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.)

How many baths did the molten sea hold? A bath is about 5.81 gallons
or 22 liters. I have seen this as 9 gallons, but archeology seems to
support about 6 gallons. We seem to have a contradiction between I Kings
which says 2,000 baths and II Chronicles which says 3,000 baths. (I Kings
7:26 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought
like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand
baths.) (II Chronicles 4:5 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and
the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies;
and it received and held three thousand baths.) Again a closer look at
these verses shows in II Chronicles the molten sea "held" 3,000 baths, but
the priests only filled it 2/3 of its capacity with 2,000 baths as seen in
I Kings, thus it contained an actual amount of 2,000 baths though it could
hold 3,000 baths.

When did Adam die? Many say he did not die as God said he would.
Genesis 2 says he would die when he ate of the tree of knowledge of good
and evil in that day, though in Genesis 5 it says Adam died at 930 years
old. So is there an error? (Genesis 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.) (Genesis 5:5 And all the days that
Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.) God was
speaking of Adam's spiritual death in Genesis 2. Genesis 5 refers to his
physical death. Adam did die spiritually on the day he ate of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil. He immediately knew he was naked. This was
because his spirit was disconnected from God and he was a man of sin in
need of a Saviour in Jesus. He was spiritually dead, though his physical
body lived for 930 years. Many today live their whole physical lives
spiritually dead. This is why we all need to be saved to reconnect our
spirit with God. Adam also died in the day of his sin in God's eyes as a
thousand years is a day with God. (II Peter 3:8 But, beloved, be not
ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand
years, and a thousand years as one day.) Adam and all who have ever lived
died less than a thousand years old. So in both ways, Adam died in the day
of his sin of eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

There are many other alleged contradictions in scripture, but those
are for other sermons. Now I want to mention just two of the alleged
problems with the King James Bible. We will see the King James Bible is
superior and is the word of God. The other bible versions are not.

The first is from John 4:24. (John 4:24 God is a Spirit: and they
that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.) Jesus who was
speaking said God is a Spirit. Many false bibles say "God is Spirit" (NKJV
[New King James Version], NLT [New Living Translation]) or "God is
spirit". (NIV [New International Version], NASB [New American Standard
Version], RSV [Revised Standard Version], HCSB [Holman Christian Standard
Bible], et cetera) This is heretical. God is not the only Spirit. Angels
both holy and unholy are also spirits. (Hebrews 1:13-14 But to which of
the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool?
14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them
who shall be heirs of salvation?) Man also has a spirit though is never
referred to in scripture as a spirit. John 4:24 shows God is a particular
Spirit and is superior to the rest of the spirits. Most of the bible
versions also spell Spirit with a lower case "s". This denies the deity of
the Holy Ghost, who is the Spirit of God.

Another issue with the King James Bible is its use of Easter instead
of Passover in Acts 12. (Acts 12:4 And when he had apprehended him, he put
him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep
him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.) Even the
New King James Version (NKJV) uses Passover. Easter is the correct
translation. All English translations as well as foreign language
translations prior to the King James Bible all used Easter. If we look
back at verse three, we see it was the days of the feast of unleavened
bread. [Acts 12:3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded
further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)] The
first day of the feast was passover. If that day had already passed, then
how can Herod wait until after that day if it already happened. He would
not have waited, but brought forth Peter immediately for his death. Easter
was a non-Jewish holiday that sometimes occurred around the same time as
passover.

People need to just trust scripture and trust the King James Bible.
They need to stop making it say what they want it to say or say there are
contradictions in scripture, when all can be answered when scripture is
closely looked at and compared and trusted.
