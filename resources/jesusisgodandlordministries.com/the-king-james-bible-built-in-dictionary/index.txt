The King James Bible Built-in Dictionary

The King James Bible is the inspired, inerrant, infallible, plenary,
preserved word of God. Because the King James Bible is inspired by God
then he has left many indelible proofs that God is the author. There are
many number patterns and other things that prove the inspiration of the
King James Bible. Another thing that proves the inspiration of the King
James Bible is the built-in dictionary that God has placed in it. No other
bible has this built-in dictionary since they are not inspired from God,
but are rather the work of man. No other religious book or any book for
that matter does as well. Today we are going to look at some examples of
this built-in dictionary and show you how to use it and find it. My new
book Meaning of King James Bible Words and Phrases gives examples of this
built-in dictionary as well as examples of the proper grammar that is
found only in the King James Bible.

God placed this built-in dictionary so that his words that are found
in the King James Bible would be defined the way he defines them and not
the way man does. Just as there is only one proper interpretation of
scripture, there is only one proper meaning of a word as it is found in a
particular verse. Note that a word can have multiple meanings, but not for
that particular verse. The other reason that God provided this built-in
dictionary in the King James Bible was because he knew many people around
the world who were reading his word would not have access to a dictionary.
God never required that a person had to carry around the Hebrew and Greek
to understand his word and he does not expect people to have to have
access to a dictionary either. God as the great provider, has already
provided a dictionary with his word. God also knew that the meanings of
words would change over time and so he wants people to be able to
understand them with the same meaning as when he wrote them. The final
reason for the built-in dictionary was to prove that the King James Bible
is inspired and God is the author. No man could place a dictionary in a
bible the way God has and still maintain the meaningful text as well as
keeping the number and word patterns that are also found in the King James
Bible.

It is this very built-in dictionary that is one of the reasons that
the King James Bible is an easier reading level than modern corrupt
counterfeit bibles. It is because of this built-in dictionary that many
prisoners, children, and others who either did not know how to read or
where not very good readers became good readers. The built-in dictionary
defines words so that a poor reader can quickly become a good reader. They
may not even be aware of this built-in dictionary, but their subconscious
notices it and allows them to learn. This is one reason that school
children read the King James Bible to learn how to read. The King James
Bible also always uses proper grammar as we will look at later.

The built-in dictionary defines words with a synonym or other word
that shows its meaning. The definition can often times be found in the
same verse as the word being defined. Many times the two words are only
separated by the word "and". Here are a few examples. The word abhor has
multiple meanings. One of the meanings is hate. Psalm 119:163 shows its
meaning with the word hate that is only separated by the word "and".
(Psalm 119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.) Sometimes
the definition is found in the same verse, but is separated by more than
the word "and". Amos 5:10 is an example. (Amos 5:10 They hate him that
rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.) Abhor
can also mean to despise or neglect. Psalm 22:24 shows this meaning with
the word despised. (Psalm 22:24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the
affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but
when he cried unto him, he heard.) We see in this case how the word and
its definition are only separated by the word "nor". A third meaning for
the word abhor is to cast off or reject. This definition can be found in
Psalm 89:38 with the words cast off. (Psalm 89:38 But thou hast cast off
and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.) We see in this
case how the word and definition are once again only separated by the word
"and". Just as a secular dictionary gives multiple meanings to a word, so
does God's built-in dictionary as we saw with abhor having three different
meanings and each of these defined by God.

Another example of a word that has multiple meanings with each
defined by God is the word abominable. Abominable can mean unclean as seen
in Leviticus 11:43 which shows unclean. (Leviticus 11:43 Ye shall not make
yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall
ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.)
A second meaning of abominable is detestable as seen in Jeremiah 16:18.
(Jeremiah 16:18 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin
double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine
inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.)
We see here again how only the word "and" separates the word and its
definition. Two other definitions for this word that are defined by the
King James bible can be found in my book.

Please note that not every time the word and is used shows a word and
its definition, but many times it does and you must use the context as
found in the verse to see whether it does or not.

Sometimes a word or phrase and its definition are only separated by a
comma. One example can be seen in Leviticus 19:12. (Leviticus 19:12 ¶ And
ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name
of thy God: I am the LORD.) Other times it is only a semicolon that
separates the word or phrase and its meaning. One example is seen in Psalm
102:26. (Psalm 102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all
of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them,
and they shall be changed:)

Sometimes the definition of a word is not found in the same verse,
but one next to it. An example is the word anon as found in Mark 1:30. The
definition for this word is found in Mark 1:31 as immediately. (Mark
1:30-31 30 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they
tell him of her.
31 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.) If the
definition is not found in the same verse or the verse before or after it,
then it is oftentimes found at least in a verse in the same chapter. Here
is one example as seen in John 4:37 for the word herein which means in
this. Verse 20 shows "in this". (John 4:37 And herein is that saying true,
One soweth, and another reapeth.) (John 4:20 Our fathers worshipped in
this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought
to worship.) If the definition is not found in the same chapter then it is
often found in the chapter before or after or at least in the same book.
One example is the word betwixt found in Isaiah 5:3. Betwixt means
between. The definition for the word is given later in Isaiah 22:11 as
between. (Isaiah 5:3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of
Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.) (Isaiah 22:11 Ye
made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but
ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him
that fashioned it long ago.) On some occasions when the definition is not
found in any of these cases then God has placed it in another book.
Sometimes the books may be next to each other or very far apart and
sometimes one even has to go from the Old Testament to the New Testament
for the definition. Normally a word will be defined somewhere in
scripture. The reason that some definitions are found so far from the word
being defined is not so that God can be mean. God does this so that people
will learn to read and study his word. If God just gives the meaning all
of the time without doing much reading then people will get lazy and stop
reading the rest of the verses. God expects us to read, study, and search
out his word and in order to do that he forces us to if we truly want to
know all of the meanings to the different words. One example of a word and
definition that are found in different books is the word wilily as seen in
Joshua 9:4 which means deceitfully. This word is defined in Exodus 8:29 as
deceitfully. (Joshua 9:4 They did work wilily, and went and made as if
they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine
bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;) (Exodus 8:29 And Moses said,
Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of
flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to
morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the
people go to sacrifice to the LORD.)

Many times the first time a word is used in the King James Bible then
God will give the definition in a nearby location. One example is the word
virgin which is found for the first time in scripture in Genesis 24:16.
The word virgin has its definition of neither had any man know her given
immediately after the word with the definition only separated by a comma.
(Genesis 24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin,
neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled
her pitcher, and came up.)

Sometimes the definition of a word is found within the word itself.
The word vinegar contains the word vine. In scripture the word vine is
always a reference to grapes showing that vinegar is made from grapes.
Tetrarch was one of four rulers of a Roman province with each ruler
controlling one quarter of it. Tetra means four and arch means ruler
showing the meaning of the word. Sometimes the word contains most of, but
not all of the definition within the word being defined. One example is
the word brasen which means something made of brass. The word brass is
nearly found within the word. Other times the definition of a word can be
figured out by the word itself. One example is the word looking glass
which is a mirror. Mirrors are made of glass and are used to look into and
thus a looking glass. Menstealers is another example and shows its own
definition of those who steal men such as kidnappers and slave traders. If
the definition cannot be figured out that way, then sometimes just the
context on how the word is used in scripture can give you its meaning.
Another thing is how the word king is only capitalized for Jesus except in
a few cases which are obvious. The fact that king is only capitalized for
Jesus can soon be figured out by the studious Bible student as they read
through scripture many times.   

Sometimes a definition for a word can be found by looking at the
letters around a word such as in Acts 19:13 which shows that devils are
really evil spirits. Devils can be seen by taking the letter d from the
word had and then adding that to the word evil and the adding the s from
spirits. (Acts 19:13 ¶ Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took
upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord
Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.)

There are times that the definition can be known as God gives the
opposite of the word. Usually it is obvious or at least one word is a
known.

Sometimes a definition can be found by comparing the parallel or
companion verse to that verse. This is known as the cross reference for
that verse. The gospels contain many of the same stories with slightly
different wording and here you can at times see this built-in dictionary.
Here is an example. Matthew 3:8 has the word meet and the same verse in
Luke 3:8 shows its definition with worthy. Notice how God also combines
his number pattern as both verses are found in the same chapter and verse
number. God is so amazing how he thinks of everything. (Matthew 3:8 Bring
forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:) (Luke 3:8 Bring forth
therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within
yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is
able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.)    

The King James Bible uses the proper grammar and spelling for words.
One example is how the King James Bible uses the proper spelling for a
word when it is used as a noun and as a verb. The King James Bible uses
plough when used as a noun and plow when used as a verb just like in
proper British English. This distinction is lost in modern corrupt bibles.
Just by seeing the spelling of the word a person can know if it is being
used as a noun or a verb. A similar example is how the King James Bible
uses the word hundred when it is used as a noun and hundredfold when used
as an adjective. The King James Bible also uses proper spelling and verb
endings to let you know if a word is singular or plural or whether it is
being used in first, second, or third person. This can be very helpful in
understanding the context of a verse.    

I have only given a few examples of various ways that show you how to
use the King James Bible's built-in dictionary. There are other ways that
God uses to define his words and some involve number patterns and so forth
or reversing the spelling of a word. I am not going to get into those
things here. Pray that the Holy Ghost will open your eyes to see his
built-in dictionary. Some of these examples and others like them can be
found in my book. I would appreciate your support with the purchase of my
book and then please tell others about it.      

Many Christians are not aware that God in his infinite wisdom has
placed a built-in dictionary in the King James Bible. While many people
may not realize it they use it anyway subconsciously as they will soon
notice that it seems words define themselves or are found elsewhere. The
next time you read your King James Bible, praise God for placing his
built-in dictionary within it so that we can have a proper understanding
of his word. Please share this knowledge with other people so that they
too can grow in the Lord. We also want to use this to convert people from
corrupt bibles to the King James Bible. The fact that the King James Bible
has its own built-in dictionary also disproves the lie that the King James
Bible is too hard to understand. The built-in dictionary proves just the
opposite that the King James Bible is actually written at a lower grade
level. Often times a harder word with more syllables will be defined by a
simple word.

For those who are not saved, today is the day of salvation. Ask Jesus
to save you and then get yourself a King James Bible and you too will
quickly grow in the Lord as you learn how to use the built-in dictionary
that God has given us. Thank you Lord for this built-in dictionary and
showing that only you wrote the King James Bible.
