Animals Teaching Man  

Man originally walked with God in Adam and Eve and God taught them
everything they needed to know as he walked with them. Following Adam's
sin then man turned from God and eventually turned to idols made by their
hands. Many of these idols (actually devils) were made in the image of
birds, fourfooted beasts and creeping creatures. (Romans 1:21-23 21
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither
were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
heart was darkened.
22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like
to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping
things.) Today many people place the creature above the Creator as they
worship them. (Romans 1:25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and
worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed
for ever. Amen.) People will protect a mouse at the expense of man's
growth. Due to sin man now had lost wisdom from God and sought false
wisdom from Satan and their idols of animals. God now tells foolish man to
learn from these very creatures that they worship since they have rejected
his wisdom. These animals are wiser than people as we will see and God
says to learn from them.

God says to go to the ant and consider her ways and be wise and do
not be a sluggard. (Proverbs 6:6-11 6 ¶ Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
consider her ways, and be wise:
7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
8 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy
sleep?
10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
sleep:
11 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an
armed man.) Throughout history many people have been lazy (sluggard) and
fail to work for their food and to take care of themselves and their
family. They fail to plant crops at the right time so when harvest comes
they have nothing to harvest and therefore no food and so they expect the
government or other people to bail them out. This sluggardness or laziness
is especially prevalent in today's society as everyone wants a free
handout without doing any work for it. This even includes many professing
Christians and then they say we are uncaring if we do not help them. God
said that if you do not work then you do not eat. (II Thessalonians 3:10
For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would
not work, neither should he eat.) God said that those who do not provide
for their own are worse than an infidel. This is how serious that God
expects people not to be lazy. (I Timothy 5:8 But if any provide not for
his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the
faith, and is worse than an infidel.)

God says to consider her ways when speaking of the ant. All ants that
we see and that are doing the work of gathering food are female ants so we
see the accuracy of the King James Bible whereas other bibles say its
ways. God said those who follow the ways of the ant are wise. Think about
this that a little tiny ant that is much smaller than man is wiser than
most people. Even God's small parts of creation can teach man. These
verses continue to show how the ant will mobilize to gather food during
harvest in order to have food for the summer. These ants do all of this
without having a ruler tell them what to do. Ants do not need to be told
to work they just do it as they know what needs to be done and they know
if they do not do it then they will not survive. Too many people today
have no initiative to do anything unless they are told to do it. Ants can
carry up to twenty times their weight. God created them this way, but this
also shows how ants will more than literally carry their own weight rather
than relying on another source to do the work for them as people often do.
Today people even if they do work will do the bare minimum necessary to
keep their job and no more. Many do not "carry their own weight" and do
their share of work, but rather expect their coworkers to do all of the
work while they sit back and rest. The ant is smart enough and wise enough
to store food away so that when they cannot gather food then they can eat
of the reserves that have been saved away. This is what Joseph was
teaching the Egyptians to save food during the seven plenteous years so
that they would have food during the seven years of famine. Ants will work
together in order to carry larger food sources than they could carry alone
and they will spread out to search for food. Christians can learn to work
together rather than against one another. Ants are always on the move and
they move fast, not slowly (sluggish) like most people. They have a job
that needs to get done and they do it. Some are worker ants and others are
soldier ants. Some will provide protection to the ant hill from predators
whereas many people just sit back and never guard their homes or their
eternal souls for that matter. God says that those who want to sleep away
their days and be a sluggard then this will lead to poverty. We see this
today yet these people are still not wise enough to go and get a job in
order to survive. These people just sit back waiting for someone to feel
sorry for them and hoping for a free hand out. The ant can teach man that
hard work will reap rewards.

God again says the ant is wise along with three other animals.
(Proverbs 30:24-28 24 There be four things which are little upon the
earth, but they are exceeding wise:
25 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the
summer;
26 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the
rocks;
27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
28 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.) God
gives four small animals that we can once again learn from. One thing we
can learn is that people do not have to be big people in order to
accomplish God's work. God can even use small things to accomplish his
goals and purposes and this includes people if they will let him. When a
small Christian feels too small to do God's work that he has called them
to do then they need to remember these four small animals of God's. The
first of the four animals that are little upon the earth is the ant. God
once again in verse 25 says that the ants are not a strong people yet they
are wise enough to prepare their food in the summer so that when it gets
cold and it is harder to gather food then they will have food to survive.
Many animals never store food, but ants are wise enough to do so. God next
lists the conies which he says are feeble (weak) yet they are wise enough
to make their houses in rocks. The coney is a rabbit. Jesus spoke of the
same principle in his sermon on the mount when he said we needed to build
our houses upon rock which will last when the storm hits whereas those who
build upon sand will have their house destroyed when the storm comes.
(Matthew 7:24-27 24 ¶ Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine,
and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house
upon a rock:
25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.

26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not,
shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.) Many
people today have not learned this as they build houses on the beach. I
remember a person who built his house on stilts in the ocean in South or
North Carolina and it was destroyed when a hurricane came through. This
was an unwise individual who did not learn from the coney. The Rock that
all people need to build upon is Jesus who is the only one who can provide
a solid foundation. If you are not saved and are building upon any other
foundation such as a false god then you will be destroyed and spend
eternity in hell and the lake of fire.

God next speaks of the locust who has no king just like the ant. The
locusts which are swarming grasshoppers normally are solitary and will do
their business without a king, but at times they form large swarms that
can be up to 200 million per square mile. These swarms form on their own
without a king putting them together. The swarms are formed for their
survival and they form bands or groups. They do not need a king to get
them organized and form these bands; they just know what needs to be done
for survival. These locust swarms will work together to destroy large
areas of farmland very quickly and God even used them as one of the ten
plagues against Egypt. (Exodus 10) God is showing man what they can do if
they work together yet man is always fighting against one another. This
same principle applies to the church. If all who profess to be Christians
would truly work together for the survival of the church then they could
win many souls for the Lord by going out in swarms to spread the word of
God.

God speaks of the spider that as little as she is lives in king's
palaces. We see how God is accurate here again by saying her hands as all
spiders seen are females and spiders do not have eight legs as is taught
by man, but has hands as well. The spider will use these hands to make
silk in a king's palace. Modern bibles remove the wise spider and change
it to lizard so that people lose the teaching of the spider. The spider
will go wherever it is necessary for her to survive and Christians should
be doing the same by going wherever God sends them so that many souls
might be won for the Lord. God says all four of these animals are wise in
their ways. If only man was.

God told Israel to learn from the ox and ass. (Isaiah 1:3 The ox
knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not
know, my people doth not consider.) God told Israel that the ox knew its
owner and the ass where his master lives. The ass understands he has a
master yet Israel did not and people today do not realize that we all have
a Master as well in Jesus. (Matthew 23:10 Neither be ye called masters:
for one is your Master, even Christ.) Jesus is still Master whether a
person is saved or not; he is just not treated as Master by the unsaved,
but many professing Christians do not give him his due as Master either.
Israel and many Christians have forgotten who their owner and Master is.
If a person is a Christian then their body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
and does not belong to them. (I Corinthians 6:19 What? know ye not that
your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have
of God, and ye are not your own?)

(Proverbs 6:4-5 4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine
eyelids.
5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from
the hand of the fowler.) We see in Proverbs again how God says not to be
lazy and full of sleep. God says for us to be awake so that we can be
aware of our surroundings just like the roe (female red deer) who escapes
from the hand of the hunter who is trying to kill her. Often times deer
seem to know when hunting season is and they move around much more in
order to escape becoming a dead deer yet man never seems to learn from
animals and when God gives them insight in order to avoid danger they
ignore it. Man will almost always continue towards that danger. This is
why many people today are on a path to hell as they ignore the danger that
their spiritual house is on fire and yet they refuse to leave. These
people want to continue in their sins and avoid God in their lives. God
also mentions the bird that escapes from the hand of the fowler. These
animals escape death because they remain vigilant rather than sleep their
lives away as sluggards. 

God says to ask the beasts, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of
the sea and they will teach us since we do not want to learn from God.
(Job 12:7-8 7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the
fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
8 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the
sea shall declare unto thee.) God says all of the animals can teach man if
we ask them to just like God will teach us if we ask him to teach us. We
then need to listen when we are taught. Notice verse 8 has fishes which
shows the accuracy of the King James Bible as fishes means different kinds
of fish showing that they all can teach us if we are willing to learn from
them. (Proverbs 30:19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent
upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a
man with a maid.) God says to see the way of the eagle in the air. The
eagle will fly around to search below for prey. It does not just sit back
hoping something will come to it. The eagle places its nest high in trees
so that it can see far away in the search for food. By being high in the
sky the eagle is also well protected from predators. (Job 39:27-29 27 Doth
the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and
the strong place.
29 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.) Notice
how an eagle will often times make its nest in the crag (crevice) of a
rock just like Jesus said to build upon rock. This will make a strong nest
that will survive the storms of life. This should be a lesson for
Christians who should be like the eagle that nests high for visual
discernment and safety as Christians should also always be on the lookout
for danger from Satan as well as be on the high ground by being right with
God so they have spiritual discernment to see the danger coming and have
safety in the nest of Jesus. These lessons can help keep a Christian safe
and on the right path with God. The serpent gets upon rocks to stay warm
in the sun. God says we are to be wise like the serpent yet as harmless as
the dove. (Matthew 10:16 ¶ Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst
of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.) Lions
are strong animals that fear nothing and we as Christians who are walking
with God have no need to fear either. (Proverbs 30:30 A lion which is
strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;) Just as the hart
(male red deer) pants after water when it is thirsty, we as Christians
should pant after God. For those who are not saved they need to have their
souls convicted so that they might pant after the living water of Jesus so
that they too might be saved. (Psalm 42:1 As the hart panteth after the
water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.) Sheep are dumb
animals yet they follow the voice of the shepherd. They will easily go
astray so the shepherd must always keep an eye on them. Jesus compares us
to sheep who need Jesus as our Shepherd. We like sheep will quickly wander
towards sin and this is why we need to hear the voice of Jesus the
Shepherd so that those who are not saved will get saved and for those who
are saved we need to hear his voice so that we will stay on the path of
righteousness. (Isaiah 53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have
turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the
iniquity of us all.) (John 10:27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them,
and they follow me:)

Besides what is found in scripture, nature itself teaches us. Sharks
are able to sense when a hurricane is coming and they will swim out to
deeper water to protect themselves yet man will try to go surfing during a
hurricane in order to catch the big wave. Animals in the forest will run
away from a forest fire yet man will stay and try to protect private
property that will one day perish anyway and many lose their lives.
Animals can sense when a volcano is about to erupt. Prior to Mt. St.
Helens erupting in 1980 the deer and other wildlife began to leave as they
could sense the danger. They left to protect their lives yet one man Harry
Truman (not the president) was not even as wise as these animals and he
refused to evacuate his home and he perished when the volcano erupted.

Scripture also uses some animals to show us how not to be. The fox is
a clever, but deceitful animal and this should be a lesson for Christians
not to try and trick people especially their fellow believers. Too many
professing Christians are deceitful like the fox. Jesus called Herod a
fox. (Luke 13:31-32) False prophets as well as those who try to destroy
the church are compared to wolves. (Acts 20:29 For I know this, that after
my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the
flock.) Just as swine (pigs) enjoy wallowing in the mud, people enjoy
wallowing in sin. Just like the swine who is cleaned up will return to the
mud so will the sinner unless they are washed in the blood of Jesus and
given proper teaching by God. Just as the swine will return to mud so does
the dog to its vomit, again representing the unrepentant unsaved sinner as
well as backslidden Christians. Dogs in scripture are always negative and
represent unholy sinners. We do not want to be like dogs or swine. (II
Peter 2:22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The
dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her
wallowing in the mire.) Fowls in scripture represent devils that snatch
away the word of God when it is planted by a Christian. (Matthew 13:4, et
cetera) We need to be aware of such birds who will do this. Many are
professing Christians in the church who do not want to see people saved.
Goats in scripture often represent the unsaved such as the unsaved nations
in the sheep and goat judgment that Jesus will divide the nations into
after the end of the great tribulation.

We see how God uses animals to teach man as they have rejected the
teachings of God. God tries to show how foolish man is in that animals are
wiser than people. God is not condoning worshipping animals. It is just
the opposite in that God wants man to see how he needs to learn from the
animals and listen to God instead of themselves. These animals all have
the wisdom that they have because God created them with it. God also gave
man wisdom, but he rejected it. God wants all people to turn to his Son
Jesus and be saved and once again receive the wisdom that was intended by
God. Animals listen to God and now man needs to. Even the lowest of God's
creation are wiser than most men. It is complete foolishness to reject the
wisdom of God. For those who lack wisdom ask God for it and he will give
it to you willingly and liberally in abundance. He will not hold back.
(James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.) Call
upon Jesus today if you have learned from the animals and what scripture
has to say.
