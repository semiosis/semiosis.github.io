King James Bible to read and listen to

Below are links to the King James Bible both to read and to listen to.
More than one are given so that hopefully at least one will always work
and allow people to always have access to the most precious item a person
can own, the King James Bible. One may be able to print out their own King
James Bible from some of these websites, though there are probably better
ones for that.

https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/ (This is an online version of the
King James Bible. It includes the original 1611 spellings and the 1769
spellings found today. Text does not include the pilcrows [paragraph
markings] like a proper King James Bible should. Includes a downloadable
King James Bible to your ebook.)

http://webchannel.purebiblesearch.com/ (This page will allow you to read
the King James Bible as well as search by a verse or by a word or phrase.
This is especially good for those who do not have a concordance. The word
or phrase must be typed in exactly as found in the King James Bible. This
site is by Pastor Michael Hoggard. It does include the proper pilcrow
[paragraph] markings as the King James Bible is supposed to have. The main
website at http://www.purebiblesearch.com/ will allow you to download the
program, so you can read the King James Bible without being online. A very
good program.)

http://www.kingjamesbibles.com/ (This is an online link to the King James
Bible. Text does not include the pilcrows [paragraph markings] like a
proper King James Bible should.)

http://earnestlycontendingforthefaith.com/ReadTheKingJamesBible.html (To
read the King James Bible. Text does not include the pilcrows [paragraph
markings] like a proper King James Bible should.)
http://earnestlycontendingforthefaith.com/ListenToTheKingJamesBible.html
(To listen to an audio version of the King James Bible read by Alexander
Scourby. It does not show the text at the same time.)

https://bible.timelesstruths.org/ (You can read the King James Bible alone
or read and listen to it at the same time. Text does not include the
pilcrows [paragraph markings] like a proper King James Bible should. The
text is also not done verse by verse as in a normal King James Bible, but
set up in paragraph style.)

http://bibleprotector.com/index.htm (This website has the Pure Cambridge
King James Bible with some spellings that have been change in some modern
King James Bibles. This text was published in 1900. Some of the links
include the Dedicatory to King James I and The Translators to the Reader,
both of which are often removed in printings of today. Text does include
pilcrows [paragraph markings] as it should.)

https://www.biblestudytools.com/audio-bible/kjv/ (An audio of the King
James Bible. It does not show the verses. Audio only. The text can be seen
in another section of the website under Bible. Stick only with the King
James Bible, and do not read or listen to the other false versions.
Beware, this website is not King James Bible only believers. Text does not
include the pilcrows [paragraph markings] like a proper King James Bible
should.)
