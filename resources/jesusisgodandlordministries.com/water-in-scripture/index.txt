Water in Scripture

Water in scripture can have several meanings as most things in
scripture have multiple meanings. The main meaning of water is life as
seen with Jesus being the living water. Cultures throughout the world even
today see water as representative of life. Many wars have been fought over
water. Most large cities (such as New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, St.
Louis, London, Paris, and Shanghai) are located next to a body of water
such as the ocean, lake or river. Water is made of hydrogen and oxygen and
as we all know we need oxygen to live. Water can also represent cleansing,
destruction, healing, fear, sin, people, and many other things.

One meaning of water in scripture is seen as a cleansing agent. We
know water cleans and see that even today when we use water to bathe or to
wash our eyes if something gets in them or wash our hands before we eat.
Scripture refers to the word of God as cleansing by water. Jesus mentions
cleansing of the church in (Ephesians 5:26-27 That he might sanctify and
cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it
to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.) In Nehemiah's day
they were repairing the gates to Jerusalem and we see they repaired the
water gate which represents the word of God or the Holy Bible. (Nehemiah
3:26 Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against
the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out.) Nehemiah
reads the word of God at the water gate (had twelve to choose from).
(Nehemiah 8:3 And he read therein before the street that was before the
water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women,
and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were
attentive unto the book of the law.) See also (Ezekiel 36:25 ¶ Then will I
sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your
filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.) and (Hebrews
10:22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed
with pure water.).

We see how water was used to cleanse people when they were unclean
such as lepers or other diseases. Remember how Naaman the captain of the
king of Syria was cleansed of leprosy after dipping himself seven times in
the Jordan river. If any man had a running issue out of his flesh, he was
to wash in water and be clean at evening time or a man whose seed of
copulation go out of him. (Leviticus 15:5 And whosoever toucheth his bed
shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until
the even.) (Leviticus 15:16-17 16 And if any man's seed of copulation go
out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean
until the even. 17 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed
of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.)
Those who touched the dead had to wash. We now know washing helps kill
germs. The cleansing of lepers and their houses required a clean bird be
used in the cleansing process. (Leviticus 14:50 And he shall kill the one
of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:)

Prior to sacrifices being made, the animals and the priests had to be
washed in water. Ten lavers of brass were filled with water for the
priests to use to wash themselves. (Exodus 30:20 When they go into the
tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die
not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering
made by fire unto the LORD:) The water represented being cleansed by
Jesus. (Leviticus 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with
water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it
is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the
LORD.) (Leviticus 8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water;
and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for
a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD
commanded Moses.)

Water is seen healing in John 5:4 (man with infirmity at the pool of
Betheseda) and in John 9:7 (blind man at pool of Siloam that Jesus
anointed his eyes with clay he had spit on). (John 5:4 For an angel went
down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever
then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of
whatsoever disease he had.) [John 9:7 And said unto him, Go, wash in the
pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way
therefore, and washed, and came seeing.] Even the water in the spittle of
Jesus has cleansing and healing powers. [Note also that man was made from
the dust of the ground and Jesus used clay to heal him.]

In Solomon's Temple there was a molten sea that separated the Holy of
Holies from the rest of the temple. I believe this sea was a type or
symbol of the sea that is between the second (outer space) and third
heavens (God's throne).  There is still water in outer space and there
used to be a water layer between the first (atmosphere) heaven and the
second heaven that was destroyed in the flood. See (Genesis 1:6-8 6 ¶ And
God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it
divide the waters from the waters. 7 And God made the firmament, and
divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which
were above the firmament: and it was so.  8 And God called the firmament
Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.) (Psalm 148:4
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the
heavens.) I also believe this is the sea of glass John sees in Revelation
4:6 and Revelation 15:2. (Revelation 4:6 And before the throne there was a
sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round
about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.)
(Revelation 15:2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire:
and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image,
and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of
glass, having the harps of God.) I believe it appears as glass since it is
frozen ice and is calm and reflects Jesus. This sea along with the earthly
sea will be no more with the new heaven and new earth. (Revelation 21:1
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first
earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.) I believe God removes
it since there is no reason to keep separation from people as sin is no
longer around. The sea of glass separated sin from heaven and seas here on
earth divide people from other lands. We see water is blue such as the
saying "sailed the ocean blue". Blue represents division or separation.
This is seen in priests clothes separated for God or the blue veil in the
temple separating the holy of holies or the blue sky separating us from
outer space. No longer needed with Jesus. The word blue is not mentioned
in the New Testament.

Seas often time represented evil in olden times. I think that is why
when Jesus walked on the water, he not only showed he was God and his
control over the world, but also represented his triumph over evil. I
believe God allowed Satan to bring forth this storm to try and destroy his
Apostles. This is also seen when the Israelites crossed the Red sea and
the flooded Jordan river. The water (evil) tried to separate God's people
from the Promised Land.

Water quenches fire, but not the fires of hell. The people of hell
have rejected the living water of Jesus and therefore cannot even get a
drop of water to quench their thirst as seen in the true story of the rich
man in Luke 16:19-31. (Luke 16:19-31 19 ¶ There was a certain rich man,
which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every
day:

20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his
gate, full of sores,

21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's
table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the
angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham
afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send
Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my
tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst
thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is
comforted, and thou art tormented.
26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so
that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass
to us, that would come from thence.
27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send
him to my father's house:
28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also
come into this place of torment.
29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear
them.
30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the
dead, they will repent.
31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither
will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.) This is not a
parable. The rich man is still in hell desiring a drop of water he will
never get. 

Water can be destructive as seen in the global flood of Noah's day as
seen in Genesis 6-10. All life was destroyed except the eight people on
board (Noah, his three sons and their wives) and the animals on board. The
water of the flood also cleansed the earth by removing the sin and
wickedness covering the earth. The earth was given a new birth and
beginning with those on the ark. This is similar to when true Christians
are baptized in water by immersion. (There is also baptism by fire when
one receives the Holy Ghost. This was seen on the day of Pentecost. See
(Matthew 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear:
he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:) and (Acts 1:5
For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost not many days hence.) and (Acts 2:3 And there appeared unto them
cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.) Being
baptized represents the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus and shows
publicly we are followers of him. It shows when we are submerged the death
of our old sinful nature and the rising out of the water represents the
resurrection of our new born again bodies. Just as washing with water
washes dirt away, baptism washes away symbolically our sins. It does not
save anyone, but represents our new birth just as a baby is born from
water in the mother's womb. When the water sac breaks, the birth of the
baby is near. [Side note that abortion is always murder as it is a baby in
the womb. It is murder even if the child is from rape or incest or if the
health of the mom is endangered. Rachel died giving birth to Benjamin as
did Phinehas's wife when giving birth to Ichabod. God is in control if he
wants them both to live. Killing one person to save another is still
murder, as is physician assisted suicide.] Jesus told Nicodemus we must be
born again. (John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I
say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
God.) (I Peter 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.)
This is why baptism must be by immersion and not sprinkling. One does not
drown or die by sprinkling and the word baptizo from which baptism comes
from, means immersion. John also mentions again that we must be born twice
(natural and spiritual). (John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say
unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God.) One must be born twice and die once for
eternal life. Those who are born once and die twice will spend eternity in
hell and the lake of fire.

We see Jesus in the cloud (made of rain drops) that led the
Israelites by day in the wilderness and kept them cool in the heat of the
day by giving them shade and gave them life by helping prevent
dehydration. We also see Jesus in the Rock that Moses struck when the
children of Israel murmured while wandering in the wilderness. I
Corinthians tells us that Rock was Jesus. (I Corinthians 10:4 And did all
drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that
followed them: and that Rock was Christ.) The people murmured again and
this time Moses was told to speak to the Rock, but in his anger with the
people he struck the Rock. God did bring forth water, but because of his
disobedience God did not allow Moses to enter the Promised Land. The Rock
as Jesus represented the first time Moses struck it as the first coming of
Jesus as a beaten and scorned man. The second time Moses was to speak to
the Rock as it represented the Second Coming of Jesus in all his glory as
King of kings. Moses destroyed the image of the type for the people and
thus brought about his premature death. We see when Jesus was pierced on
the cross, water and blood came out.

We see water representing life. Our physical bodies need water to
survive, even more frequently than food. We see in scripture how the
people wandering in the wilderness or desert searched for water and the
cities such as Jerusalem had elaborate water canals to collect water. Our
bodies are made of about 57-60% water. A lack of water causes many
illnesses and disease as well as hunger and fatigue and even death if too
little. Severe dehydration may cause one to see a mirage of water such as
in a desert. Just as one needs to drink approximately 64 ounces of water a
day for their physical body, they need to water their spiritual bodies
daily by reading the word of God.

Water reflects light such as seen in a rainbow. Jesus is the light of
the world and the colors of the rainbow represent the gospel and the
salvation message of Jesus that the light represents. (John 8:12 ¶ Then
spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that
followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
life.) Frozen water or ice is also reflective.

We see the abundance of life in the sea, far more than on land and
notice that sea animals were created a day before the land animals. Flood
waters once receded bring forth great crops as seen in such places as in
Dutchtown in our local floods and allow food for life by regenerating the
soil. Rain brings forth life by bringing forth food to live.

Ice (frozen water) freezes from top to bottom, whereas all other
liquids freeze from bottom to top. God did this so that animals living in
water may have life. If it froze from the bottom up, the animals would
die. Again water represents life.

Snow which is another form of frozen water often represents purity
and cleanliness in scripture. Fresh snow is pure white and is nature's way
of showing the purity and cleanliness of Jesus and as a form of water it
also represents Jesus as the living water. The blood of Jesus makes us
whiter than snow. The blood of Jesus can make the filthiest person clean
and whiter than snow. (Isaiah 1:18 Come now, and let us reason together,
saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as
snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.) Wool of
sheep is also white and pure of which Jesus is our passover lamb. God the
Father's garment was white as snow and his hair like pure wool. (Daniel
9:7 ¶ I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days
did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like
the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as
burning fire.) We see the raiment (clothing) of Jesus is also white as
snow when he was transfigured on the mount before Peter, James, and John
as well as when John saw him in Revelation 1 the hair of Jesus is white as
snow. (Mark 9:3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow;
so as no fuller on earth can white them.) (Revelation 1:14 His head and
his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a
flame of fire;) The angel that appeared after the resurrection of Jesus
was also in white raiment like snow. Jesus makes one pure. (Matthew 28:3
His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:)

Jesus told the Samaritan woman at the well in John chapter 4 (four
represents the gospel) who came looking to fulfill her physical thirst
that what she needed was living water which he would give her if she
asked. Jesus said he would give a well of water springing up into
everlasting life. Jesus told her she would thirst again with her water,
but with the water he would give, she would never thirst again, nor will
anyone else who drinks of it. (John 4:10 Jesus answered and said unto her,
If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me
to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee
living water.) (John 4:13-14 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever
drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never
thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of
water springing up into everlasting life.) Just as water quenches your
thirst, Jesus quenches your soul. Jesus said those who believe in him
shall have rivers of the living water. [John 7:38-39 38 He that believeth
on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of
living water. 39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe
on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that
Jesus was not yet glorified.)] The Holy Ghost is the living water that
Jesus gives us. We see the Holy Ghost moving over the water in Genesis 1:2
bringing forth life. (Genesis 1:2 And the earth was without form, and
void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters.) (Isaiah 12:3 Therefore with joy shall
ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.)

We see in the Old Testament that the Jews rejected the living water
of Jesus. (Jeremiah 2:13 For my people have committed two evils; they have
forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns,
broken cisterns, that can hold no water.) and (Jeremiah 17:13 O LORD, the
hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that
depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken
the LORD, the fountain of living waters.)

The new heaven has a pure river of water of life flowing from God's
throne, just as God provided rivers of water for Adam and Eve in the
garden of Eden. God is the living water and he is pure. (Revelation 22:1
And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.) Jesus told John that
all who thirst for the living water will receive it. (Revelation 21:6 And
he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of
life freely.) The Holy Ghost sends one last plea for the lost to come and
receive of this living water (Jesus) (Revelation 22:17 And the Spirit and
the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that
is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life
freely.) Just as our physical bodies need water; our spiritual bodies need
the living water of Jesus.
