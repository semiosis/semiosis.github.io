Jesus versus Mohammad

Islam claims that both Jesus and Mohammad were prophets with Mohammed
being the last prophet and the greatest prophet. Scripture clearly shows
that there is no comparison between the two historical figures and how
Jesus is really the greater.  

Mohammad was born a man of a woman just like the rest of us, but
Jesus was born of a virgin so the miraculous account of Jesus starts with
his birth. (Isaiah 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign;
Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
Immanuel.) The Koran also admits that Jesus was born of a virgin, but
Mohammed was not. (Surah 19:20 She wondered, "How can I have a son when no
man has ever touched me, nor am I unchaste?") Unchaste means involved in
sexual activity.

Mohammad claimed to be only a man which he was, yet Jesus said he was
the Son of God and yet also still man as the Son of man. Mohammed said he
was a prophet and nothing more. (John 10:30 I and my Father are one.)
(John 10:36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into
the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?) (Mark
10:45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.) Scripture shows Jesus
to be the Creator. (John 1:3 All things were made by him; and without him
was not any thing made that was made.) (Colossians 1:16 For by him were
all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and
invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
powers: all things were created by him, and for him:) Mohammed was just a
creature and was made by the Creator and he never claimed otherwise.   

Mohammed said he received his revelation from an angel and he claimed
he did not know if it was evil or not, but Jesus said he got his from God
the Father. (John 5:19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he
seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the
Son likewise.) God was pleased of his Son Jesus as he personally
commissioned him into the ministry whereas the angel Gabriel supposedly
called Mohammed. (Matthew 3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is
my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.)  

Mohammed fought in many battles and encouraged his followers to
fight. He killed many people whereas Jesus never killed anyone, but rather
raised people from the dead. (Luke 7:14-15 14 And he came and touched the
bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he
said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him
to his mother.) Jesus also never fought in any battles, but instead said
to love your enemies. (Matthew 5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies,
bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;) Jesus condemned the
people that were trying to make him king in order to overthrow the Roman
government, yet Mohammed encouraged disorder against government.

Mohammed stole from many people as he conquered them whereas Jesus
never stole from anyone. God condemns thievery. (Exodus 20:15 Thou shalt
not steal.)

Mohammed had at least eleven wives [some sources say over twenty],
including Aisha that he married when she was six. He was married to many
at the same time and he also had concubines. Many of his wives had been
divorced. God condemns such things. (Matthew 5:32 But I say unto you, That
whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication,
causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is
divorced committeth adultery.) Jesus never married. The church is the
bride of Jesus.

Mohammed had little regard for females. Mohammed said that a man
could beat his wife in Surah 4:34. Mohammed said in the Hadith that women
were only half as smart as men and that the majority of those in hell were
women. He also said you could mortgage women. 

Mohammed owned slaves while Jesus never did. Jesus cared for the
poor, the lame, slaves, and others while Mohammed oppressed them and used
them for his purpose. This fact alone should discourage blacks from
converting to Islam.

Mohammed is never said to have performed any miracles, yet Jesus
performed many miracles during his ministry including raising the dead,
giving sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and walking to the lame.
He did other miracles as well such as feeding five thousand men with five
loaves of bread and two fishes, casting out devils, healing lepers, and
walking on water. (Luke 7:21-22 21 And in that same hour he cured many of
their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that
were blind he gave sight.
22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what
things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the
lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the
gospel is preached.) The Koran also says Jesus did many miracles including
also raising the dead and healing lepers. It also attributes some to Jesus
that scripture never says he did. Surah 3:49 is speaking of Jesus. (Surah
3:49 and ˹make him˺ a messenger to the Children of Israel ˹to proclaim,˺
'I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I will make for you a bird
from clay, breathe into it, and it will become a ˹real˺ bird-by Allah's
Will. I will heal the blind and the leper and raise the dead to life-by
Allah's Will. And I will prophesize what you eat and store in your houses.
Surely in this is a sign for you if you ˹truly˺ believe.)   

Mohammed was never said by Muslims to be able to have foreknowledge
of things whereas it attributes this to Jesus. Muslims say that Jesus was
able to answer all questions that were asked of him and to know what
things a person had in their homes or what they had just eaten. Scripture
describes this attribute of Jesus as well. We call this omniscience which
is an attribute of God only and means all knowing. Jesus in scripture read
people's thoughts. (Matthew 9:4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said,
Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?)

Mohammed taught Muslims to pray repetitious prayers which God
condemns whereas Jesus taught his disciples to pray from their heart.
Muslims pray five times a day facing Mecca and say the same words over and
over. (Matthew 6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the
heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much
speaking.) Muslims make a big show of praying whereas Jesus taught to pray
privately in your closet. (Matthew 6:5-6 5 ¶ And when thou prayest, thou
shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the
synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of
men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast
shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which
seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.)  

Mohammed taught that people who did not willingly become Muslims must
be forced to become Muslims or be killed. Jesus never taught that. Jesus
said to preach the gospel to all creatures, but if they refuse and want to
go to hell then their blood is on them. Jesus never said you had to kill
someone who refused to become a Christian.

Mohammed brought darkness to the world as he turned people away from
Jesus and to Satan who Allah is. Allah was the moon god of Mohammed's
tribe and so Mohammed was pushing idolatry. Scripture says behind every
idol is a devil. God condemns idolatry. (Exodus 20:3 Thou shalt have no
other gods before me.) Jesus on the other hand brought light to the world
as he came as the Saviour of the world. Jesus came to bring us salvation
from sin and Satan whereas Mohammed put Muslims in bondage to sin. The
Koran recognizes that Jesus brought the gospel to man and approves of it.
They just say that scripture has distorted the gospel, but they do see it
as a good thing. Jesus said he was the only way to heaven. (John 14:6
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh
unto the Father, but by me.)  

Mohammed admitted to being a sinner as does the Koran whereas Jesus
was the only sinless man or any person to ever live. (Surah 48:2 so that
Allah may forgive you for your past and future shortcomings,perfect His
favour upon you, guide you along the Straight Path,) (II Corinthians 5:21
For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be
made the righteousness of God in him.) (I Peter 2:22 Who did no sin,
neither was guile found in his mouth:)   

Mohammed often times saved his own life at the expense of the lives
of others. Jesus gave his life for his friends and enemies. Jesus even
taught that we should be willing to give our lives for our friends whereas
Mohammed said to save yourself. (John 15:13 Greater love hath no man than
this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.) Jesus gave his life
as the passover sacrificial lamb so that everyone might be saved. (I John
3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for
us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.)  

Mohammed had thoughts of suicide after getting the supposed
revelations from Gabriel whereas Jesus was obedient to God's calling and
faced the devil in the wilderness. (Matthew 4:1 Then was Jesus led up of
the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.) Jesus never
ran away from his calling or acted like a coward as Mohammed did. The
Hadith confirms that Mohammed had suicidal thoughts.

Mohammed taught that Muslims need to take pilgrimages to Mecca when
Jesus said to go out into the world and preach the gospel, but never said
a Christian had to go to Jerusalem, his empty tomb, or anywhere else.

Mohammed said that Allah had abrogated or replaced some parts of the
Koran whereas Jesus taught that all of scripture is inspired and
profitable for doctrine. (II Timothy 3:16 All scripture is given by
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness:) He said he came to fulfill
the law, not get rid of it. (Matthew 5:17 ¶ Think not that I am come to
destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to
fulfil.) Jesus never said any part of scripture was no longer valid as
many people say today.

Mohammed died and his body remained in the grave while his soul and
spirit went to hell. Jesus died for our sins so that we did not have to
die. He took our place on the cross for us. Jesus died and was buried and
rose again from the grave on the third day. (Mathew 28:6 He is not here:
for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.)
(Mark 16:6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of
Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the
place where they laid him.) The tomb of Jesus has remained empty since
that day and Jesus remains alive today never to die again. Jesus sits at
the right hand of God the Father in heaven. Jesus is the true way to
heaven and not Mohammed or Islam. Mohammed was a false prophet and was
from Satan and not God. Allah is not God, but rather a devil. For Muslims
listening then please leave Islam and realize that Jesus is the only way
of salvation. Jesus is the true Prophet of God and the true final prophet
and the only one that spoke the truth. Mohammed will only lead you on a
path to hell. The life of Jesus was much greater than that of Mohammed and
even the Koran bears that out if you truly open your eyes to see. Reject
Mohammed and choose Jesus today and choose life.
