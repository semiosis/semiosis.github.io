The Gospel in Stone

I have previously preached on the gospel in the stars. Today I am
going to preach on another controversial subject that is a parallel to
that sermon. The Great Pyramid in Egypt is God's gospel in stone. Some
call it the Bible in Stone. Joseph A. Seiss wrote Miracle in Stone on this
topic. Just as God revealed to Adam the gospel in the stars, I believe
that God had Noah and maybe Shem to build the Great Pyramid for a witness
after the flood. Noah would obviously had help in building the pyramid,
but God used Noah to get it done. The gospel in stone has been taken over
by Satan to become pyramidology just as Satan changed the gospel in the
stars to astrology. Freemasonry and other occultists have tried to
sabotage the gospel in stone. People have tried to link the Great Pyramid
with UFO's and aliens saying they built it in order to discredit it. Satan
always attacks God's word and twists it for his own evil purpose. All
other pyramids are just Satan's copies of the real thing. Most preachers
will avoid this subject yet God speaks of it in scripture just as he does
the gospel in the stars and he has left the physical evidence in the Great
Pyramid.

The Great Pyramid is located in Giza, Egypt and is the last remaining
of the ancient seven wonders of the world. It is located about nine miles
south of Cairo, the capital of modern Egypt. The Egyptians and secularists
claim this pyramid was built for pharaoh Khufu and that is why it is
sometimes referred to as Khufu's pyramid, but I will show you that no
pharaoh was ever buried in it. The Great Pyramid is the oldest and largest
of the ancient pyramids in Egypt with all others being much smaller and
not as well built. The Great Pyramid was the only pyramid built with
passage ways inside and the only one with ventilation. The others as tombs
for the pharaohs were not ventilated in order to preserve the body. This
is one thing that shows that Khufu was not buried here besides the fact
that the tomb is empty and there is no evidence of anyone ever being
buried there. There are no inscriptions in the pyramid to any pharaoh.

There is dispute on how old the pyramid is with secularists claiming
it is about 4,600 years old as they claim that was when Khufu lived. This
would place it before the Genesis flood that occurred about 4,400 years
ago. Those who understand that this pyramid was built as a witness for God
still disagree on who built it and when. Some claim that Adam built it
while others say it was Enoch with this being the only structure to
survive the flood. There is some evidence to back up Enoch. Others say it
was Noah or Shem after the flood. I believe it was Noah and Shem after the
flood who built it as it was a witness for after the flood. Remember at
this time there was still no written Bible. I also do not think the
pyramid could have survived the violence of the global flood with the
earthquakes, violent waves, volcanic eruptions and other things, but if
God did have it built prior to the flood by Enoch or someone else and
wanted to preserve it for his glory then he could. For the sake of this
sermon we will assume that it was built after the flood by godly men and
not Egyptians for a dead pharaoh.

The Great Pyramid covers 13 acres at its base and about five acres on
each side. It is 454.5 feet tall and was the tallest structure in the
world for about 3,400-3,600 years. It has been said there are 2.3 million
stones in the pyramid and enough to build a four foot high wall and one
foot thick for 3,600 miles. Napoleon claimed the stones could build a ten
foot wall all the way around France. Some of the stones are said to weigh
up to 80 tons (some say only 50-70 tons, but no matter what they are
heavy) which we could not even move today. Even with helicopters and other
modern construction equipment we could not build the Great Pyramid today
and especially at the accuracy that it was built. The original pyramid was
covered in 144,000 polished casing stones that made it shine. The
Egyptians called it the Shining Light as it shone forth light from the sun
that is believed would have been seen on the moon. Most of these have
since been removed and stolen by thieves. The stones were so closely put
together that you often times could not even find the seams and you cannot
even get a piece of paper to fit in between them. This shows the
protection of Jesus that nothing gets through and how Jesus as the
foundation of the church has his people tightly fitted together to form
one body of Christ. As Christians we have Jesus living in us. (Ephesians
2:20-21 20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;
21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy
temple in the Lord:) The 144,000 represents the future Jewish witnesses
during the tribulation with 12,000 from each of the twelve tribes of
Israel. (Revelation 7:4 And I heard the number of them which were sealed:
and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the
tribes of the children of Israel.) The shining stones represent Jesus as
the light of the world which one must have in order to be saved. Jesus is
the true light and Satan the false light. (John 8:12 ¶ Then spake Jesus
again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me
shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.) The
Israelites were forced to make bricks which were used in many later
pyramids which can help date the time of the exodus. (Exodus 5:7 Ye shall
no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go
and gather straw for themselves.)

God said he would place a witness to him in Egypt and this is the
Great Pyramid. (Isaiah 19:19-20 19 In that day shall there be an altar to
the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border
thereof to the LORD.
20 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in
the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the
oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he
shall deliver them.) God says he would place an altar to the LORD in the
midst of the land of Egypt, but he also says it will be a pillar at the
border thereof. Verse 20 shows it is to be for a sign and for a witness
showing that the Great Pyramid was built for a purpose to glorify God and
not as a burial tomb for a heathen pharaoh. It also speaks of a coming
Saviour which is Jesus. We know from Joshua that not all altars for God
were built for sacrifices such as when the two and a half tribes on the
other side of the Jordan built an altar as a witness so that they as well
as the tribes on the other side would always serve God and the two and a
half tribes would not be forgotten by the other tribes on the other side
of the Jordan. These verses clearly show the altar is for a witness and
not for sacrifice. (Joshua 22:26-28 26 Therefore we said, Let us now
prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
27 But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations
after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our
burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings;
that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no
part in the LORD.
28 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or
to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the
pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt
offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.)
God forbid altars used for sacrifices to be made of hewn stone, but this
same restriction did not apply to altars built as witnesses such as the
Great Pyramid which was made of hewn stone. (Exodus 20:25 And if thou wilt
make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if
thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.) People say how can
the altar, which in this case is the Great Pyramid, be in both the middle
of Egypt and on the border of Egypt. Ancient Egypt used to be divided into
the Upper Kingdom and the Lower Kingdom. The Great Pyramid is built on the
border of these two kingdoms and when they united it was now also in the
middle of Egypt just as God said. The Great Pyramid is also at the border
where the fertile Nile Delta with all of its crops meets the desert of the
Sahara where nothing grows. There is a spiritual application here as well
as only Jesus is the living water and everything else brings death just
like what is found in the desert.

The Great Pyramid was built as a witness for God. I already showed
the connection to the 144,000 witnesses and Jesus as the light of the
world. The Great Pyramid has three chambers inside it. As I previously
stated no other Egyptian pyramid has any chambers let alone multiple ones.
The pyramid also has air ventilation which no tomb has. There is one broad
chamber that descends down to a pit that is actually dug into the bedrock
and goes down below the pyramid. This chamber represents the broad path of
destruction which most people take and they end up in hell and the lake of
fire (the pit). They end up here for rejecting Jesus as their Saviour.
Jesus said we need to take the narrow path for everlasting life. (Matthew
7:13-14 13 ¶ Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and
broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go
in thereat:
14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto
life, and few there be that find it.) There are 153 steps inside the Great
Pyramid which matches the 153 fish of John 21:11. (John 21:11 Simon Peter
went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and
fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net
broken.) Some have said this represents the number of nations that will be
in the millennial kingdom. Whatever the meaning of the number I do know
there is some significance to it and it is no coincidence. One thing it
shows in John is the security of the believer of once saved, always saved
(net does not break) and this may be the same in the pyramid. The middle
chamber is known by Egyptologists as the Queen's chamber named by Arabs
many years ago. It is agreed even by scholars that it was never intended
for burial of a queen. This passage partly ascends to the top of the
pyramid, but suddenly at the 25^th block level of the pyramid it becomes a
straight passage parallel with the ground. The shaft goes to about the
middle of the pyramid and dead ends. Some red colored stone has been found
in it. This passage represents the Israelites who started out as God's
chosen people and on the right path to heaven (ascending section), but
then the straight path shows the Jews rejecting Jesus and bringing about
his crucifixion. The dead end shows that without Jesus you cannot move on.
The red represents the blood on their hands from then until Jesus returns
at his second coming. (Matthew 27:25 Then answered all the people, and
said, His blood be on us, and on our children.) The final main passage
ascends towards the top of the pyramid and is known as the King's chamber
and is located on the 50^th row of stones. The chamber is made of red
granite stone and only contains an open empty coffer box. This coffer box
has the exact same cubic capacity of the ark of the covenant. Not a
coincidence. This passage represents the red blood shed by Jesus on the
cross for all mankind for us sinners to receive salvation and how we must
ascend for true life. The empty tomb represents the empty tomb of Jesus
and his resurrection which guaranteed us everlasting life. The granite
represents Jesus as the Rock and the stone upon which all must be built
upon. (I Corinthians 10:4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for
they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was
Christ.) (Matthew 21:44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be
broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.) We
must swallow our pride and fall upon Jesus as we come to him and admit
that we are a sinner and ask for him to save us. If we reject him he will
fall on us and crush us. This is even seen in the very large stones in the
Great Pyramid. The passage is a narrow passage unlike the broad one that
descends down to the pit. I already read in Matthew 7:13-14 how we must
take the narrow path to get to Jesus and everlasting life. The fact that
the chamber is located on the 50^th row represents the Holy Ghost.
Pentecost was fifty days after passover and it was on this day that the
Holy Ghost was first received by believers and the church was started. All
true believers are a temple of the Holy Ghost. (I Corinthians 6:19) The
Jubilee for the Israelites was every fifty years when no crops where to be
planted and all slaves were released and debts forgiven. This represented
the debt forgiven of our sins when we are saved and now are indwelled with
the Holy Ghost. The King's chamber contains two ventilation shafts which
represent how Jesus brings breath and life to us. I have already mentioned
how a tomb has no ventilation shafts as those inside are dead. It has been
said that the pyramid was built so that the light of the star Sirius would
shine into the King's chamber through these air shafts (some say the
Queens's chamber) when it rose. This may or may not be true, but as I
showed in my sermon The Gospel in the Stars Sirius represents Jesus as the
Prince so it would connect the two stories of the gospel presented by God.

The Great Pyramid is the only Egyptian pyramid that does not have a
top stone. The top of the pyramid is flat. People try to say this stone
was removed over the years, but this is not true as it was intentionally
built this way. The missing top stone represents the rejection of Jesus
not only by the Jews, but by nearly all people since Cain. Jesus is the
cornerstone upon which all must be built upon, but he is also the top
stone that completes the link to restore our relationship to God. This is
done by receiving Jesus as your Saviour. The cornerstone is the bottom
stone on the corner which the rest of a building is built upon. The way
the pyramid is designed with this flat top, if a top stone was placed on
it then it would be both a cornerstone since this is the only spot that
covers all four corners as if it was the foundation as well as a capstone
(top stone or pyramidion) to seal off and complete the pyramid and the
salvation that all men need. I already read Ephesians 2:20 which shows
Jesus is the chief corner stone. (Matthew 21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did
ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected,
the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and
it is marvellous in our eyes?) Matthew shows how it was the Lord's doing
that Jesus was the corner stone and would be rejected and I believe it was
also the Lord's doing to intentionally leave off the top stone of the
pyramid representing the rejection of Jesus.

There is only one door going into the pyramid just as there is only
one door to everlasting life and Jesus is that door that we must enter
through. (John 10:9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be
saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.) Jesus said in John 10:1
that those who try to enter through another door are thieves and that is
what happened in the Great Pyramid. This door was so well hidden that it
was only recently found and robbers broke into the pyramid as they could
not find a door. Jesus and the gospel is hidden to most as they are not
saved and willingly reject Jesus. (II Corinthians 4:3 But if our gospel be
hid, it is hid to them that are lost:) The Great Pyramid has been damaged
over the years and I think even this was allowed with purpose just as
Jesus was wounded on the cross for us. It is not destroyed just as Jesus
was not destroyed as he rose from the grave.

The Great Pyramid was built using the pyramid inch which is slightly
larger than the British inch. This is known since inside the Ante-chamber
is a granite leaf that shows the scale of construction of the Great
Pyramid. A Hebrew cubit was 25 pyramid inches. It was at that time called
the sacred inch and was the same inch used to build Noah's ark, the ark of
the covenant, and Solomon's temple. Stonehenge was also built with this
measurement and there is some evidence that it may be linked to the Great
Pyramid, but I would have to do more research on that. The base length of
the pyramid is 365.24 which equals an earth solar year of 365.24 days. A
solar year is one revolution of the earth around the sun. Enoch died at
365 years old for a connection to him. A biblical calendar is 360 days.
The height of the pyramid times one billion is the distance from the earth
to the sun. The cubit of 25 inches times ten million gives the polar
radius of the earth. These measurements were not known by the Egyptians at
the time. There is a diagram inside the pyramid measured in inches with
each inch supposedly representing a year that many have said shows world
events such as the birth of Jesus and the two world wars. This may be
accurate and maybe not, but it would not surprise me if it was. I would
have to do more research, but I would not rely strictly on it for prophesy
as interpretations could be wrong. Trust your King James Bible for that.

The pyramid contains other earth measurements such as the Great
Pyramid weighs exactly 1/10 billionth as much as the earth. The pyramid
was built using the mathematical PI (3.14) which was not known by the
Egyptians, but God as the great mathematician knew of it. The molten sea
in Solomon's temple also was based off of PI used for the radius of a
circle's circumference compared to its diameter which is 3.14. (II
Chronicles 4:2 ¶ Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to
brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of
thirty cubits did compass it round about.) The pyramid is aligned with
true north and is located exactly on the longest longitude line and the
longest latitude line on earth. It is located at the only point the two
meet. This divides all earth landmass into four equal places with the
Great Pyramid at its center point so there is an equal amount of land on
all four quarters of the pyramid. Whoever God had build the pyramid knew
the dimensions of the earth which God had to reveal to them. There are
many other measurements as well revealed in the Great Pyramid.

I have clearly shown that it was God who was the architect of the
Great Pyramid and not the Egyptians. There are far too many things that
are beyond the ability of people to have done the things that this pyramid
represents. Just as with the stars, God left his gospel story in stone. I
have often wondered if the Great Sphinx that is located nearby also has a
connection. The Great Sphinx has the head of a man and the body of a lion
and has been said to be of pharaoh Khufu, but I believe it represents
Jesus as the God-man showing him as man and the back as the Lion of the
tribe of Juda as seen in Revelation 5:5. It faces from west to east with
east meaning Jesus Christ having it point people to Jesus. For those who
are not saved please call upon Jesus today as we see God cared so much
about you that he left the message of his Son Jesus Christ in stone. Stone
is a hard permanent substance just as life with Jesus is. The new
Jerusalem may be a pyramid shape with the Great Pyramid as a type of it.
