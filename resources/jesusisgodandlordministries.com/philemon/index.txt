Philemon

Philemon is the 18^th book of the new testament and the 57^th of the
Holy Bible. Philemon is one of the shortest books in the new testament
with only one chapter of twenty five verses and was written by Paul. This
short book falls between Titus and Hebrews. Some say he wrote this letter
about the same time he wrote Colossians. Philemon along with Ephesians,
Philippians, and Colossians are known as Paul's prison epistles or letters
and it is believed they were written during Paul's first imprisonment in
Rome.  

The book of Philemon is about a slave Onesimus who was Philemon's
slave who had run away and eventually ran into Paul who led him to the
Lord and he got saved. It is believed that Philemon and Onesimus lived in
Colosse or maybe Laodicea. Onesimus was at least a Colossian. (Colossians
4:9 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They
shall make known unto you all things which are done here.) Paul wrote this
letter to Philemon who it seems Paul also led to the Lord in asking
Philemon to forgive Onesimus and receive him back as a new brother in
Christ rather than as a slave. Philemon had the authority under Roman law
to punish Onesimus, but Paul was asking Philemon not to punish him as now
he was worthy as a Christian brother. Paul reminded Philemon how much he
owed Paul for leading him to the Lord and he asked for the same treatment
for his former slave. The number twenty five means forgiveness of sins and
as I said earlier Philemon only has twenty five verses and this book is
all about forgiving sins of those who have wronged us. Eighteen means
bondage and the book of Philemon is about the bondage of Onesimus and the
bondage of sin of the unsaved.

Philemon teaches us that all who are Christians are equal in Jesus
Christ, no matter if we are rich or poor, Jew or Gentile, servant, or free
or what color of skin we have or male or female. Jesus places us all on a
level playing field. Onesimus had run away from his master in Philemon for
whatever reason. God guided him to Rome where he met Paul and got saved.
God will often supernaturally guide people to Christians that he knows
will give them the gospel they need to hear. Paul was one of those
Christians. As Christians we need to be ready for someone coming to us.
Paul reminds Philemon that his servant was now saved and so they were
equal in Jesus Christ.

(Philemon 1 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our
brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,) The first
verse shows us that Paul was a prisoner at the time he wrote this book.
Paul was a prisoner in Rome at the time yet he does not say he was a
prisoner of the Roman emperor, but rather of Jesus Christ as it was
because of his preaching of Jesus Christ that Paul was in prison. It
appears that Timothy was in prison with Paul though it is possible that he
was just there for encouragement and comfort though we know Timothy was in
prison at least once and Paul often mentions him with him in his prison
epistles. (Hebrews 13:23 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at
liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.) Philemon is shown
as a fellow Christian when referred to as a fellwolabourer and Paul
clearly loves him.

(Philemon 2 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our
fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:) Paul also mentions a
couple other believers with Archippus being a fellowsoldier so he must
have been strong in spreading God's word. Philemon apparently had a church
in his house. Most churches were house churches at this time due to
persecution of believers. History says Apphia was Philemon's wife and
Archippus his son. This may or may not be true.

(Philemon 3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ.) Paul wishes grace to all of them and peace, but shows these
things only come from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(Philemon 4 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my
prayers,) Paul says he thanks God and that he mentions Philemon always in
his prayers. Paul was always remembering those he taught and ministered to
even after he had long moved on to a new location. We should to. Paul also
realizes that it is only by God that he can do this and he also thanks God
for letting him having met Philemon.

(Philemon 5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the
Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;) Paul said he has heard of Philemon's
great love to the Lord Jesus as well as to the saints (all true
Christians). Philemon also had great faith. These two things are necessary
to make a strong Christian who is a soul winner. Philemon seems to have
Jesus first in his life just as he and all of us should.

(Philemon 6 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual
by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.)
Paul tells Philemon that his faith will remain strong if he understands
that all he has is due to Jesus Christ. True faith will be seen in our
communication.

(Philemon 7 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love,
because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.) Paul
said that fellow believers have been refreshed by Philemon in the great
joy he brings them. When a Christian is on fire for the Lord this will
bring great joy to believers especially if it is someone you led to the
Lord as Paul had with Philemon.

(Philemon 8 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to
enjoin thee that which is convenient,) Paul is saying he needs to talk to
Philemon about a matter (Onesimus) and he could be bold about the matter
as an apostle, but he will not use that authority, but rather seek out
Philemon as a friend and brother in Christ.

(Philemon 9 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an
one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.) Paul said
that he would talk to Philemon not as an apostle, but in love's sake
almost as a dad to Philemon as Paul was now getting old. Paul again says
he is a prisoner of Jesus Christ and not of Nero who was probably the
Roman emperor. Paul is proud to be in prison for serving Jesus and not the
least bit ashamed. We should not be either.

(Philemon 10 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten
in my bonds:) Paul now says he is writing to Philemon on behalf of his son
Onesimus. Onesimus was not a literal son of Paul, but a child in that Paul
had led him to the Lord while in bonds (while still in prison). As an
older Christian this would make Paul his dad as we are to treat older
Christians as dads and younger as brothers. (I Timothy 5:1 Rebuke not an
elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;)

(Philemon 11 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
profitable to thee and to me:) Paul says he know Onesimus had been
unprofitable to Philemon, but he says he is now profitable to him as a
fellow believer. It is only Jesus who makes a person profitable. Onesimus
had been an unbeliever and just a slave to Philemon, but now as a fellow
believer he had become profitable as he worked for the Lord.

(Philemon 12 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that
is, mine own bowels:) Paul says he has sent back Onesimus to Philemon as
this was the right thing to do even though he was more profitable to Paul
there in Rome with him. Paul says for Philemon to receive him back as if
he was Paul's own son.

(Philemon 13 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he
might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:) Paul says he
would have preferred to have kept Onesimus with him since he has
ministered unto him while Paul was in bonds.

(Philemon 14 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy
benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.) Paul says
he wants Philemon to receive Onesimus back as a believer, but he as an
apostle will not force Philemon to do so, but wants Philemon's own
conscience to do the right thing.

(Philemon 15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that
thou shouldest receive him for ever;) Paul says that perhaps God had
Onesimus to run away knowing that he had ordained a meeting with Paul so
that Onesimus would get saved which he would not have if he had not run
away. Paul says by Onesimus running away Philemon could receive him back
forever as a brother in Christ rather than as a servant.

(Philemon 16 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother
beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh,
and in the Lord?) Paul says to Philemon to no longer see Onesimus as a
servant, but rather a brother in Jesus Christ. In the flesh Onesimus was a
servant to Philemon, but in the Lord Philemon is a brother.

(Philemon 17 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as
myself.) Paul say if you see him as a partner in the service to the Lord
then to receive Onesimus just as he would if Paul came. Paul was showing
that all in Jesus Christ are equal including a former servant being equal
with an apostle. 

(Philemon 18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that
on mine account;) Paul says to put on his account for any wrong that
Onesimus had done to Philemon. Paul says you should forgive Onesimus's
debt to you, but if you cannot then Paul will pay for it just as Jesus
paid for our sin debts.

(Philemon 19 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay
it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self
besides.) Paul says he has written with his own hand that he will repay
any debt owed by Onesimus as in a signed written contract, but reminds
Philemon that he owes Paul for Paul having led him to the Lord so that now
Philemon has everlasting salvation which he probably would not have were
it now for Paul's preaching to him of the gospel.

(Philemon 20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord:
refresh my bowels in the Lord.) Paul says that for Philemon to honor his
request would bring him great joy in the Lord not just for Paul, but also
for Philemon as he believes this request is also from God. Doing the right
thing would also bring joy to Philemon.

(Philemon 21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee,
knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.) Paul says he has
confidence that Philemon will listen to Paul's request and will receive
Onesimus as a brother. He also believes that Philemon will also do the
right thing in freeing Onesimus so that he may serve the Lord.

(Philemon 22 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that
through your prayers I shall be given unto you.) Paul also asks for
Philemon's prayers for his own release and for Philemon to prepare lodging
for him when he comes to visit as he trusts that through Philemon's
prayers he will be released. By making this request, Paul seems to trust
that his release will be soon.

(Philemon 23 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ
Jesus;) Paul also asks for prayer for a fellow Colossian who is also in
prison as a prisoner of Christ Jesus. (Colossians 4:12 Epaphras, who is
one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently
for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will
of God.) These men are all prisoners for preaching Jesus and not from
doing any sinful thing that landed them in prison.

(Philemon 24 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.)
Paul names some other fellowlabourers in the Lord that need to be prayed
for as well. Notice that Mark and Luke are one of them to be prayed for.
Remember at one time Paul did not trust Mark as he left him on the
missionary field, but now he was profitable to Paul. (II Timothy 4:11 Only
Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable
to me for the ministry.)

(Philemon 25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Amen.) Paul says may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with Philemon's
spirit as he reads this letter and makes his decision about Onesimus. We
see again how grace comes from God. Scripture never says what Philemon
ever did with Onesimus, but history seems to suggest that Philemon obeyed
Paul's request and released Onesimus from servant hood. This short book
teaches us all about forgiveness and how once a person is saved they
become equal with us. This applies to even a person who was a longtime
enemy who then gets saved. Onesimus' salvation was sincere as apparently
he made a true change in his life to now serve the Lord and his people.
His was not a fake conversion in an attempt to gain freedom. May we all as
Christians grant Paul's request that is really the Lord's request to
receive all true believers as our brothers and sisters in Christ
regardless of their past, but especially those who truly love the Lord and
serve him as Onesimus was doing.
