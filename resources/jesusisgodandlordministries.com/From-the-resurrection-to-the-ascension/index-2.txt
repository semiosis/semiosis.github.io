From the resurrection to the ascension

Many preachers preach on the resurrection of Jesus as they should
since it is the most important event in history and without it we would
still be lost sinners, yet many neglect to preach on the ascension of
Jesus and the events of Jesus in the 40 day period between the
resurrection and the ascension. Following the resurrection of Jesus, he
walked on earth for forty more days, but this time in his resurrected,
glorified body to show the disciples what they could look forward to.
Jesus was able to do things in his glorified body such as walk through
walls that he could never do in his physical body prior to his
crucifixion. All of us will be able to do the same thing when we get our
glorified bodies at the rapture. During this forty day period Jesus would
give his final instructions to his disciples before ascending to heaven
and not returning physically here on earth again until his second coming
at the end of the great tribulation. There are nine forty day periods
mentioned in scripture with the last two dealing with Jesus, his first
having been his forty days of temptation in the wilderness by Satan just
before the start of his public ministry. They all have to do with trials
and temptations except for this 40 day period of Jesus between his
resurrection and his ascension were Jesus used this period as a time of
preparation, teaching and instruction with his final commands to his
disciples. It was also to show himself alive with many infallible proofs
so they could boldly preach about him to the world. (Acts 1:1-3 The former
treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and
teach,
2 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy
Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
3 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many
infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the
things pertaining to the kingdom of God:) Jesus did not appear to everyone
like he did when he walked the earth, but rather only to certain people.
(Acts 10:40-41 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;
41 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to
us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.)

During the three days and three nights that Jesus was in the grave he
went and preached to the spirits in hell. (I Peter 3:18-19 For Christ also
hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring
us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:
19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;) This
does not refer to unsaved people who had died as people are never referred
to as spirits in scripture, they are only said to have a spirit. Jesus
never preached to the unsaved people as people can never get a second
chance at salvation following death which is why people need to choose
Jesus while they are still alive. These spirits are not the wicked people
of Noah's day as many people teach. In scripture spirits refers to angels
and in this case it refers to those angels who sinned with the women in
Genesis 6 producing the giants. Jesus preached to these evil angels to
proclaim victory over them and that their impending doom was now sealed.
Jesus also preached to them that he had taken captivity captive and was
going to release all of those who were saved and bring them to heaven
following his resurrection. Prior to the resurrection of Jesus, the old
testament saints were held captive by Satan, but now Satan was defeated
and his doom sealed as Jesus rose victorious from the grave. [Ephesians
4:8-10 8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
captive, and gave gifts unto men.
9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into
the lower parts of the earth?
10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all
heavens, that he might fill all things.)]

Jesus rose from the grave on that glorious early Sunday morning which
we call Resurrection Day which was the feast of firstfruits as our
firstfruits of resurrection. (I Corinthians 15:20 But now is Christ risen
from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.) Jesus had
to rise first and get his glorified body first before any saints who had
died could get theirs. This also allows us to get ours in the future for
those who are saved. Early in the morning at sunrise of that resurrection
day several women including Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jesus,
Salome, and Joanna and other women brought spices and ointments for the
preparation of the body of Jesus since they were unable to finish it prior
to the sabbath following the crucifixion of Jesus. (Matthew 28:1 In the
end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,
came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.) (Mark 16:1-2
And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of
James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and
anoint him.
2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto
the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.) (Luke 23:56-24:10) (John 20:1 The
first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark,
unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.)
Notice that these women just as the male disciples did not believe Jesus
when he said he would rise from the grave for if they did then they never
would have come to prepare his body. If the men believed then they would
have come early in the morning as well to see the empty grave. An angel
appeared to them to tell the women that Jesus was not there, but was risen
as he said he would. The angel told them to hurry back and tell the
disciples and Peter. Peter was specifically mentioned not because he was
above the other apostles as the Roman Catholic Church teaches, but rather
because Peter had denied Jesus three times and God wanted Peter to know
that he had been forgiven and was still loved by God and would still be
used by Jesus. The women did as they were told and then Peter and John ran
to the grave to see and Mary Magdalene followed along. After the men saw
the empty grave, they left, but Mary stayed behind and wept. It was at
this time that Jesus made his first appearance following his resurrection
as he spoke with Mary Magdalene. Mary thought he was the gardener, but
then Jesus said that it was him and for her to go and tell the disciples
that she saw him. (John 20:14-18 And when she had thus said, she turned
herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She,
supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne
him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him,
Rabboni; which is to say, Master.
17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my
Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father,
and your Father; and to my God, and your God.
18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord,
and that he had spoken these things unto her.) Notice that it was Mary
Magdalene a woman who was given the privilege of being the first person to
see the resurrected Jesus and not one of the male apostles or disciples.
God is no respecter of persons. (Acts 10:34 ¶ Then Peter opened his mouth,
and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:) In
verse 17 Jesus told Mary not to touch him until he had ascended to his and
Mary's Father and his and Mary's God. This does not refer to the ascension
but was rather a part of the redemption of mankind. Jesus ascended to
heaven to place his blood on the heavenly altar which completed the
redemption for all people. This completed what was started on the cross at
Calvary and was necessary for if Jesus had never placed his blood on the
heavenly altar to be accepted by God the Father then we would still be
dead in our sins. Mary was not allowed to touch Jesus so she did not
pollute him as she was unclean due to sin. Once Jesus returned from heaven
then he could be touched as was seen later on the same day.

Once Jesus completed the work necessary for man's redemption and
returned from heaven on that same resurrection day then he next appeared
to the women that had come to the grave as they were on their way to tell
the disciples what the angel had said. At this point he could now be
touched and was as the women held his feet and worshipped him. Jesus did
not stay long in heaven before returning. (Matthew 28:9-10 ¶ And as they
went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And
they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they
go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.)

The next appearance by Jesus on that resurrection day was to Cleopas
and another disciple of Jesus who was Peter as they were walking from
Jerusalem to the nearby town of Emmaus. (Luke 24:13, 18) (Luke 24:34
Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.) (I
Corinthians 15:5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:) This
appearance can be found in Luke 24:13-35 and in (Mark 16:12-13 ¶ After
that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and
went into the country.
13 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they
them.). When they first saw Jesus they did not know it was him as Jesus
appeared in another form. Jesus asked them why they were sad and they said
do you not know what happened over the last three days and Jesus said what
things. They told him about Jesus and then Jesus scolded them and began to
relate to them about what the scriptures have to say about Jesus beginning
with Moses and the prophets. The men's hearts burned within them as Jesus
spoke. When they got to Emmaus then Jesus sat at a meal with them and
opened their eyes so they knew it was him and then he disappeared. Jesus
in his resurrected, glorified body could now move at the speed of thought
and vanish and reappear in new locations. These two men went back to
Jerusalem to then tell the other apostles and disciples.   

Jesus' next appearance on this resurrection Sunday was in the evening
at meal time to all of the apostles as well as other disciples in
Jerusalem where they were shut up in a house behind closed doors for fear
of the Jews. (John 20:19-23 19 ¶ Then the same day at evening, being the
first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were
assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and
saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
20 And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side.
Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.
21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath
sent me, even so send I you.
22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them,
Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
23 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose
soever sins ye retain, they are retained.) During this appearance to the
apostles and disciples then Jesus opens their eyes to understand scripture
and what Jesus had taught them during his 3.5 year earthly ministry. Jesus
used this time to instruct them to preach repentance and that all people
needed their sins forgiven by Jesus. (Luke 24:45 Then opened he their
understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,) In the Luke
account found in Luke 24:36-49 we see Jesus ate with the disciples in
verse 43 which shows how we will still be able to eat with our glorified
bodies. Also found in (Mark 16:14-18 ¶ Afterward he appeared unto the
eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and
hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after
he was risen.
15 And he said unto
them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
16
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they
cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it
shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall
recover.) John 20:19 shows how Jesus was able to appear out of nowhere
into the middle of a room with a locked door. This shows how in our
glorified bodies we also will be able to appear into a room without having
to enter through a door or window. Some of the disciples in this room may
have been some of the people whose graves were opened at the crucifixion
of Jesus. Scripture says over 500 people saw Jesus during this 40 day
period at one time, but many are not mentioned on the exact timing when.
(I Corinthians 15:6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren
at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are
fallen asleep.) Jesus was busy on this resurrection Sunday making many
appearances in multiple places.

Jesus next appeared eight days later on the following Sunday before
his disciples who were again in this same room. Jesus did this since
Thomas was not there when Jesus came the last time and he said unless he
could see the nail prints in the hands of Jesus and touch his pierced side
then he would not believe. Jesus came so that Thomas could see and touch
him. When Thomas saw he believed and called Jesus his Lord and his God.
(John 20:24-29 24 ¶ But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not
with them when Jesus came.
25 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But
he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails,
and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his
side, I will not believe.

26 ¶ And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with
them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and
said, Peace be unto you.
27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands;
and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not
faithless, but believing.

28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast
believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.)
Jesus said blessed are those who believe without seeing as we must do
today. Verse 30 says Jesus did many other signs that are not written.
(John 20:30-31 ¶ And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of
his disciples, which are not written in this book:
31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.)  

Jesus next appeared to seven of the disciples as they were fishing on
the sea of Galilee. (John 21:1-2 After these things Jesus shewed himself
again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed
he himself.
2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of
his disciples.) The disciples had been fishing all night without catching
anything but Jesus called out to them from the shore and told them to cast
their net on the right side. They did not realize it was Jesus, but did as
he told them and they caught 153 fishes. It was then that John realized it
was Jesus and they all headed to shore. It has been said that the 153
fishes represent the 153 people mentioned in scripture who received a
direct blessing by Jesus. It also represents how these disciples will now
be fishers of men's souls just as God commanded them rather than fishing
for their own pleasure. 153 is 9 x 17 with 9 meaning the fruit of the
Spirit and 17 means victory. We get victory by obeying the Holy Ghost. We
see Jesus eating again in this account here in John 21. Jesus restores
Peter as useful for him. (John 21:15-19 ¶ So when they had dined, Jesus
saith to Simon
Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto
him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto
him, Feed my lambs.
16 He saith to him again the second
time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord;
thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
17 He saith unto him the third
time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he
said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord,
thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto
him, Feed my sheep.
18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst
thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old,
thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry
thee whither thou wouldest not.
19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when
he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.)

There appears to be at some point that Jesus may have appeared to his
brother James as seen in I Corinthians 15:7 (I Corinthians 15:7 After
that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.) and that Jesus also
met the disciples in Galilee as the angel said he would and told in
Matthew 28:16-18. (Matthew 28:16-18 16 ¶ Then the eleven disciples went
away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
18 And Jesus came and spake unto them,
saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.)

The final appearance of Jesus during this 40 day period mentioned in
scripture is his ascension from the mount of olives. Jesus had spoke of
this future event to his disciples during his 3.5 year ministry. (John
6:62 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was
before?) This is on the 40^th day since his resurrection. The ascension is
mentioned in three places; Mark, Luke, and Acts. Many modern bibles either
remove one or more of these places or at least casts doubt on the
ascension belonging in scripture with footnotes. (Mark 16:19 ¶ So then
after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and
sat on the right hand of God.) (Luke 24:50-51 ¶ And he led them out as far
as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them,
and carried up into heaven.) (Acts 1:9-12 9 And when he had spoken these
things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out
of their sight.
10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold,
two men stood by them in white apparel;
11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in
like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which
is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.) Just before his ascension,
Jesus commanded the disciples to remain in Jerusalem and to wait for the
Comforter, who is the Holy Ghost whom he would send. Ten days after the
ascension of Jesus on the feast of Pentecost, the Holy Ghost was given to
the disciples. Jesus would later appear to Paul on the road to Damascas
but he was in heaven. (Acts 9:3-6 And as he journeyed, he came near
Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:
4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto
him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to
do? And the Lord said unto
him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.)
Jesus will not return here to earth until his second coming. Just before
his ascension he commanded the disciples to go into all the world and
teach the nations and tell the people how they needed to repent and
confess that they are a sinner and call upon Jesus to be their Saviour.
The same command applies to us today. They were then to baptize the saved
people in the name of the Godhead and Jesus includes himself showing he is
God. This command is known as the Great Commission. (Matthew 28:19-20 ¶ Go
ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:
and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.)
Following the ascension of Jesus, the disciples no longer hid in fear, but
became bold in preaching Jesus to a lost and dead world.

I have shown the various appearances of Jesus from his resurrection
to his ascension as best as I can as it can be challenging to piece all of
the accounts given in the gospels, Acts, I Corinthians, and other places
in scripture. Following the ascension of Jesus he now sits on the right
hand of God the Father, as many places in scripture show, waiting for the
timing of his second coming as King. For those who are not saved, realize
that you are a sinner and call upon Jesus today so that you too may say
even so come Lord Jesus as we await his second coming which will be soon.
