False Religion of Hinduism

Hinduism is the world's third largest religion after Christianity and
Islam. There are about 1.2 billion Hindus. At one time Hinduism was
referred to as Brahmanism. The religions of Jainism, Buddhism, and Hare
Krishna all take some of their beliefs from Hinduism as the root of those
religions is Hinduism. Most are found in India and Hindu is the national
religion of India. India is the only Hindu nation, though Nepal and
Mauritius have a majority Hindu as well. Hinduism is said to be the oldest
religion in the world, but this is not true as there has always been true
believers of Jehovah God and Satanism in its various forms is the oldest
religion in the world. Hinduism consists of philosophies, rituals, many
gods and goddesses, pilgrimage sites, yoga, mythology, and many other
beliefs. The major writings of Hinduism are the Vedas. This is their holy
book. The four main denominations of Hinduism are Vaishnavism, Shaivism,
Shaktism, and Smartism. These divisions are based on the major god they
worship. Vaishnavism is Vishnu, Shaivism is Shiva, Shaktism is Devi, and
Smartism is based on five gods all considered equal. The Om is the symbol
used to represent Hinduism just as the cross represents Christianity.
Hinduism is based on six main schools of philosophy. These are Sankhya,
Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa, and Vedanta. The two most popular today
are Vedanta and Yoga. Yoga is also found in Buddhism. Yoga has become
popular today among Christians and many others besides just Hindus and
Buddhists. No true Christian should have anything to do with Yoga. How sad
many churches today including some Baptist churches have yoga classes in
the church and encourage their members to participate. One of the things
in yoga is for the person to try and empty their mind of all thoughts and
to meditate. This opens the door to Satan and his minions. God does not
want a Christian to empty their mind or do this kind of meditation. God
wants a Christian to meditate upon his word and to fill their mind with
the Holy Ghost. (Ephesians 5:18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is
excess; but be filled with the Spirit;) If our minds are full of God, then
there is no room for Satan. Yoga also consists of many chants that do not
honor God. God also said not to use vain repetitions. (Matthew 6:7 But
when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think
that they shall be heard for their much speaking.) The beliefs of Hinduism
vary greatly among Hindus and has often been said to be many religions in
one religion. Hinduism absorbs many of India's culture and traditions and
the government believes that a person cannot be a true Indian if they are
not a Hindu. Hinduism does not worship one specific god, but rather many
gods and goddesses. Hinduism does not claim any one individual as its
founder. Hinduism beliefs have greatly affected Hollywood and the movies
coming out of it. Hindus worship in temples. Some Hindus become monks just
as in Buddhism. Many Hindus take pilgrimages.

Here are some beliefs of Hinduism:

1. Dharma- Dharma is considered the main goal of every Hindu. Dharma
includes behaviors that are said to be in accord with the universe. This
is known as rta. Other aspects of Dharma are religious duties, being good,
and your social order. Social class that a person is born into in India is
very important. We see dharma consists of good works and religion. Dharma
is the highest a Hindu can reach.

2. Artha- Artha is the pursuit of wealth for one's living as well as for
their political and social status. All Hindus strive to reach Artha. God
said money is the root of all evil. (I Timothy 6:10 For the love of money
is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred
from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.) God
also said it is hard for those who trust in riches to enter heaven. (Mark
10:24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth
again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust
in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!) A person needs to turn from
money and to Jesus for their salvation.

3. Kama- Kama is the pursuit of one's sensual pleasures so the Hindu is
satisfied. God said we need to turn to him for pleasure, not pleasures of
this world. (II Timothy 3:4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of
pleasures more than lovers of God;) (Titus 3:3 For we ourselves also were
sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and
pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.)
(Luke 8:14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they
have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures
of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.)

4. Moksa- Moksa means liberation or freedom from samsara (reincarnation).
Some Hindus refer to this as Brahman. When a Hindu reaches this point then
they no longer die and know their true self or essence. When a Hindu
reaches moksa they supposedly finally have happiness and peace. Jesus
brings true peace. (I Corinthians 1:3 Grace be unto you, and peace, from
God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.) One school of belief
(Vedantic) says that Moksa is the liberation in this life and another
liberation after death. If a Hindu wants true liberation then they must
turn to Jesus for salvation as only he can give true freedom from death.
(Romans 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
free from the law of sin and death.)

5. Karma- Karma is the belief that a Hindus actions or works in either
their current life or their past lives affects the way they live now as
well as what they are reincarnated as in the next life such as social
status or as an animal rather than a person. Scripture does say a person
reaps what they sow, but this is not karma that is being referred to in
scripture. Hindus believe in good karma and bad karma.

6. Samsara- Samsara is the belief in reincarnation. Hindus believe they
are born and then die and then are born again and die and just continue
this endless cycle until they are able to reach moksa. Hindus believe
their karma affects how they are reincarnated. Hindus believe a person can
be reincarnated as an animal such as a rat. This is why Hindus are careful
not to kill many animals because the bug you squash might be grandpa. If
it was I would think you would be doing him a favor so he can come back as
something better. Rats are considered holy animals and often run around in
their temples. It is believed that the sons of Karni Mata came back as
rats. A Hindu better hope they do not reach moksa after being reincarnated
as a rat. One of their gods is associated with rats. Hindus believe that
their current works and efforts assist with their reincarnation status as
well as reaching moksa. Scripture says that we only die once and once we
die comes the judgment. (Hebrews 9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once
to die, but after this the judgment:) There is no reincarnation. A person
either goes to heaven or hell when they die depending on whether they
received Jesus as their Saviour or not. A person also could not become an
animal as scripture says we reproduce after our kind. A rat always makes a
rat and a person always a person.

Hinduism has their own calendar and has many festivals based off of
the moon. The best known one is Diwali. This festival has postage stamps
issued for it including here in the United States. Diwali is also known as
the festival of lights. Diwali lasts five days and is during the Hindu
month of Kartika (mid-October to mid-November on our calendar). Diwali is
often associated with the goddess Lakshmi who is the goddess of wealth and
prosperity. She is also the wife of the god Vishnu. We see how important
wealth is again to Hindus. Diwali celebrates the false light of Satan.
Hindus need to turn to the true light of Jesus who is the light of the
world, not Satan who only masquerades as light, but is really darkness.
(John 8:12 ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of
the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
the light of life.) (II Corinthians 11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself
is transformed into an angel of light.)  

Hindus worship millions of gods and goddesses. Some estimate it is
around 333 million gods and goddesses. Some are more important than others
and some schools of Hindus have certain gods or goddesses more important
than another school of Hinduism. Vishnu is one of the major gods for all
Hindus and the supreme god for Vaishnavism, a major Hindu denomination.
Brahma and Shiva are two other main gods in Hinduism. Devi is very
prominent in Shaktism. Some other important Hindu gods are Ganesha who is
the elephant god (elephants are important in India), Hanuman, the monkey
god, the goddess Lakshmi, the goddess Durga who rides a lion, the goddess
Kali, who is the goddess of death, and the goddess Saraswati who is the
goddess of knowledge, art, and music. Kali is often portrayed standing on
her husband Shiva who is the god of death. Kali is portrayed with her
blood soaked tongue sticking out. The Rolling Stones logo is based off of
Kali's tongue. Children and other people are often sacrificed to Kali.
Kali is probably the most feared god or goddess in India. Hindus just need
to turn to Jesus Christ and they would have no need to fear any Hindu god
as they are all controlled by Satan whom Jesus created. I also mentioned
the rat is revered in India. The elephant god Ganesha rides on a rat. The
Karni Mata Temple which is also known as the Temple of the Rat has over
25,000 black rats running around inside and they are all worshipped. The
rats are believed to be the ancestors of Charans who were warriors. Karni
Mata is said to be the incarnation of the goddess Durga.   

Hinduism is very much a part of India. The government has made it
illegal to try and convert a Hindu and forbids Hindus from leaving
Hinduism. Hindus will kill those who try and often attack and kill
non-Hindus, similar to the violence seen in Islam.   

Hinduism has more than one creation story. One says the divine god
made a self and things sprang from it. One says the world came from an egg
that sat for a year before hatching. One story says Vishnu creates and
destroys and keeps recreating and destroying the universe. One says Brahma
sprang forth the earth and split into two to form man and woman and then
became one again. When he dies the universe dies. His life of one day is
said to be equal to billions of years in man's eyes. Brahman is considered
the ultimate reality in the universe. It is the final cause of all that
exists. There are other strange stories.   

Hindus believe in heaven and hell, but only as temporary places. A
person goes to one or the other depending on their karma. Bad karma goes
to hell and good karma to heaven. Hell is torment and punishment and one's
length of time in hell depends on their past deeds.   

Hinduism has many religious books. These books are to guide the
Hindu, but are not followed word for word the way the Holy Bible is for
Christians or the Koran for Muslims. The top writings of Hinduism are the
Vedas and are said to be the oldest religious writings to man. There are
four Vedas Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharaveda. Another religious
book is the Puranas, along with Unpanishads which is also known as
Vedantas. Some other writings are Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagwad Gita, and
Devi Mahatmya.  

Hindus believe in ancestral spirits that can be good or evil and
Hindus will often try to appease them to keep them happy. They are often
worshipped.

The cow is sacred to Hindus. Most Hindus are vegetarians and much of
their food contains dairy products. The cow is seen as mother of all
beings and God's gift to mankind. Hindus consider killing a cow as if you
killed your mom. It is illegal in most Indian states to kill a cow. Most
places in India forbid the selling of beef. The cow is also worshipped by
Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs.

Job 40:21 in the King James Bible mentions shady trees, but many
modern bibles change this to lotus, lotus trees, or lotus plants. The
lotus plant is connected to Hinduism where it represents rebirth
(reincarnation) and enlightenment (Satan). This shows the corruption of
modern bibles as they support Hinduism. 

For any precious Hindu that may be listening, please turn from the
false religion of Hinduism and its many false dead gods and goddesses
which will only lead you to hell and turn to the one true living God
Jehovah and to his Son the Lord Jesus Christ who died for your sins. Admit
that you a sinner and need a Saviour and call upon Jesus today to save you
and be your Saviour. Do it now before it is eternally too late.
