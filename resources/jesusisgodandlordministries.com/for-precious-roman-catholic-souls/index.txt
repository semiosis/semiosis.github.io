For Precious Roman Catholic Souls

Roman Catholic souls are very precious just as all souls in the world
are. I care about their souls as much as I do about all souls and love
Roman Catholics as I do all people. This is why the hard truth about Roman
Catholicism and the Roman Catholic Church must be told so that Roman
Catholics may be truly saved. The Roman Catholic Church uses a lot of
terminology as if they are true Christians, but has different meanings
from the real thing. The Roman Catholic Church is false Christianity. The
Roman Catholic Church is about being religious, when true Christianity is
about having a personal relationship with Jesus, not being religious. The
Roman Catholic Church is the largest cult in the world. There are over 1.2
billion Roman Catholics worldwide. Most Roman Catholics do not realize
they are in a cult since their leaders keep them in the dark by
discouraging them from reading scripture and coming to know the truth. The
leaders say only they know the truth and only they can give it to the
laymen. The Roman Catholic Church is highly controlled by Satan. The Roman
Catholic Church as all cults adds to scripture. They add additional books
and verses as well as removes verses from scripture. They have their own
bibles which have been corrupted. [They have also influenced all English
bibles except the King James Bible. The Roman Catholic Church hates and
despises the King James Bible because it condemns the Church and shows
they are false. The leaders know the King James Bible is the truth.] They
have traditions which override scripture if tradition contradicts
scripture. The Roman Catholic Church also has additional books in the
Catechism of the Catholic Church which is the final authority of the Roman
Catholic Church even over scripture and contains its traditions (which are
considered the word of God as is scripture) and false doctrines, the
Missal which is a liturgical book which contains all instructions and text
such as scripture, prayers and responses to the priest for Mass as well as
the Breviary which is a liturgical book for praying the canonical hours
(Liturgy of the Hours) and contains prayers, hymns, Psalms, readings, and
notations. It often has words of the "saints" and "Church Fathers." The
Breviary is usually used by the bishops, priests, and deacons for the so
called Christians' daily prayer. God hates rituals and repeating prayers.
(Matthew 6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen
do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.) The
Catechism of the Catholic Church is the final authority on all Roman
Catholic doctrine, not scripture. The Roman Catholic Church as all cults,
say salvation only comes through them. They minimize Jesus as all cults do
plus they elevate Mary. The pope is a god to them as is Mary. The Roman
Catholic Church elevates Mary above Jesus. As all cults do as well as all
false religions, the Roman Catholic Church requires works for salvation.
Jesus did the work for us by dying on the cross. The Roman Catholic Church
even has its own country in the Vatican and at one time controlled a vast
empire and influenced many world leaders with fear of excommunication and
eternity in hell if they did not obey the pope. The Roman Catholic Church
has persecuted the true church of Jesus Christ and executed many true
Christians over the years. The Roman Catholic Church teaches many false
doctrines and teachings. The saying has always been that all roads lead to
Rome. The Roman Catholic Church will only lead a person's soul to hell and
eternity in the lake of fire. Even the pope has no assurance of going to
heaven. If the leader of the Church does not have security of his
salvation, how does the average Roman Catholic have any hope of being
saved and going to heaven. This section on Roman Catholicism is not a hate
section, but is meant to show the truth to the precious Roman Catholic
souls being deceived by Satan. I pray that if you are a Roman Catholic,
you will read through the articles and pray and ask Jesus to reveal the
truth to you whether what scripture says is true or what the Roman
Catholic Church and the pope says is true. If you ask Jesus in sincerity,
Jesus will show you the danger of the Roman Catholic Church and that only
he is the way to salvation and heaven. The following articles below will
reveal various things about the Roman Catholic Church to hopefully lead
you to the truth. My prayer is that all Roman Catholics will find the true
Jesus and true salvation and be truly born again including the pope and
the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church.

I challenge you (dare you) to read the entire articles on Roman
Catholicism before you make judgment so that you may know the truth. The
truth hurts and will make you free. Jesus said in (John 8:32 And ye shall
know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.) I know this will make
you angry, but read on and let me explain my statements and defend them.
You should want the truth. If one said something to me about Baptists I
would not hate them, but would see if what they were saying was true.
See What must I do to be saved (be born again), have eternal life and go
to heaven?
