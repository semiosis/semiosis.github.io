God is Light

God is light. Light is necessary for life and we will see that the
real light that one needs is Jesus as their Saviour. I John 1:5 shows us
that God is light and that there is no darkness in him. (I John 1:5 This
then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that
God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.) Light represents purity
and as God is pure there can be no darkness in him. Darkness represents
evil. We see this how crime is much more rampant at night. People are
afraid of the dark. Satan loves the dark and tries to keep all others in
the dark as well as he spreads his evil. The unsaved love the darkness and
hate the light as they know the light represents Jesus. (John 3:19-21 19
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men
loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made
manifest, that they are wrought in God.) Because God is light and light is
pure and there is no darkness in him then God had to create darkness to
allow people a choice to serve him as the light or to serve the darkness
of Satan. (Isaiah 45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make
peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.) This verse shows
God created darkness and evil which the darkness represents. When God
created the heaven and the earth on day one then he had to create darkness
as he as light already existed. God formed light for here on earth, but he
did not create it as God is not a created being. We see in Genesis 1:2-5
how God created the darkness to start off the day and then formed light to
shine forth in the second part of the day. This is why the Jews day starts
at sunset as darkness came before God let the light shine through. This
represents how we are born as sinners in darkness and then only receive
light after we are reborn as sinners washed in the blood of Jesus. Jesus
was the light for the first three days until he created the sun and was
the light for the plants to survive on day three. (Genesis 1:2-5 2 And the
earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the
deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.                                                        
3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was
light.                                                 4 And God saw the
light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the
darkness.                                                                                                                                
5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the
evening and the morning were the first day.) II Corinthians 4:6 shows how
God commanded the light to shine out of the darkness during the second
half of the day. We see this in Genesis 1:3 when God said let there be
light. (II Corinthians 4:6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out
of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.) God commanded his Son
Jesus to shine forth out of the darkness as a symbol of his bringing light
to the world when he came to earth as a man.

Jesus said he is the light of the world. (John 8:12 ¶ Then spake
Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that
followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
life.) (John 9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the
world.) Only Jesus is true light and only he can bring salvation to man.
Satan is the false light and is in reality darkness. (II Corinthians 11:14
And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.)
True light can only shine forth when Jesus as God is here on earth,
whether physically or living in Christians hearts. This is why some
nations shine forth much brighter than other nations as so many nations
have almost no true Christians so they have no light of Jesus to shine
forth. I have preached on it before how we as Christians are supposed to
shine forth the light of Jesus by reflecting that light. We are to be a
lighthouse to the world so that the world should see Jesus when they see
us. (Matthew 5:14-16 14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set
on an hill cannot be
hid.                                                   
15 Neither do men
light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it
giveth light unto all that are in the
house.                                                          16 Let
your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
glorify your Father which is in heaven.) (Philippians 2:15 That ye may be
blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a
crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;)
We see in these verses how we are to be a light on the hill shining
brightly and are not to hide from the world. We as the light of the world
must tell others about the light of Jesus. I have said this before, but
the reason that the whole world was dark for the last three hours when
Jesus was dying on the cross is because he as the light of the world bore
the sins of the world and took upon himself all the darkness and evil that
mankind has or ever will do. The light of the world died for you and me.
(Luke 23:44-45 44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a
darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.            45 And the
sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.) Verse
45 shows that the sun was darkened as well, as the sun is a type of Jesus
and if the real thing was dying then so does the type. We see in John 1
that Jesus is called Light four times. The number four means gospel as
Jesus is the gospel. John the Baptist bear witness of Jesus as the true
Light. (John 1:7-9 7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the
Light, that all men through him might believe.  

8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
Light.                               9 That was the true Light, which
lighteth every man that cometh into the world.) Jesus brought light not
only to the Jews, but the Gentiles as well. Jesus as light shined in the
darkness, but darkness did not comprehend or understand the light as
darkness as sin is the polar opposite of light and its purity. (John 1:4-5
4 In him was life; and the life was the light of
men.                                                                 5 And
the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.) The
sinful world is darkness and will never understand Jesus. This is why we
need to let the light of Jesus shine on us so that we can allow it to work
and open our eyes to understand we need to be saved and then seek out that
light. Jesus came to be a light to the world so that we might be pulled
from the darkness and to light and be saved for those who believe in him
as their Saviour. (John 12:46 I am come a light into the world, that
whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.) When Jesus was
brought to the temple to be presented to the Lord then Simeon recognized
Jesus as the light of the world. (Luke 2:32 A light to lighten the
Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.) When Jesus spoke to Paul on
the road to Damascus then a great light that was Jesus shone around Paul
at noontime. The light of Jesus outshone the sun to spotlight Paul. (Acts
22:6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh
unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light
round about me.) (Acts 22:11 And when I could not see for the glory of
that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into
Damascus.) (Acts 26:13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from
heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them
which journeyed with me.) We see Paul gets saved in chapter 22. In
scripture the number 22 means light and it is the light of Jesus that
brings salvation to Paul who used him to be a light to the Gentiles. The
number 14 in scripture means salvation and you add eight for new beginning
and it gives you 22 or light which is life by Jesus who delivers you from
your sins.  

The light of Jesus is so glorious that when God spoke to Moses then
his light shone upon Moses and this light was still seen on his face after
Moses left to go and speak to the people so he had to wear a vail. (Exodus
34:29-30 29 ¶ And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai
with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from
the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he
talked with him.                                                       
30 And when Aaron and all the children of
Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid
to come nigh him.)

We see in other verses that light is spoken of being in Christians or
that people ignore the light. The light spoken of in these verses speaks
of the light of Jesus or the salvation which his light brings. (Luke 16:8
And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for
the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children
of light.) Luke 16:8 shows how God refers to Christians as children of
light. That is because God is light and the saved are children of God.
(John 12:36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the
children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide
himself from them.) (James 1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is
from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
variableness, neither shadow of turning.) (Galatians 3:26 For ye are all
the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.) Light is meant to be shone
brightly and as children of light then we must be obedient to God and
shine forth that light. There is a song sung sometimes in church we sing
that says of our light to "Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine". Let
this song be more than words in our hearts. Let us shine forth Jesus. II
Corinthians 6:14 shows how we as children of light are not to be unequally
yoked with children of darkness or unsaved people. Why would you as a
child of light want to return to darkness? (II Corinthians 6:14 Be ye not
unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath
righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with
darkness?) (Ephesians 5:8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye
light in the Lord: walk as children of light:) The Jews as God's chosen
people were originally intended to be the light to Gentiles, but they
failed to fulfill that as most chose darkness. (Isaiah 49:6 And he said,
It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the
tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give
thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto
the end of the earth.) II Corinthians 4:4 shows how Satan blinds people so
they will not let the light of Jesus shine upon them. (II Corinthians 4:4
In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe
not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
God, should shine unto them.) God calls all people to put off the darkness
which is sin and to put on the armour of light which is Jesus. A person
can only be saved when they put on the light or armour of Jesus. As
Christians we need to make sure we are walking with Jesus so that the
armour of light that we have will be most effective. This is the armour
that will keep us away from darkness. (Romans 13:12 The night is far
spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of
darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.)

Various things in scripture represent Jesus as light. The sun as the
brightest thing we see on earth is a type of Jesus. The sun is yellow
which represents deity. Jesus is called the Sun of righteousness showing
this connection. (Malachi 4:2 ¶ But unto you that fear my name shall the
Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go
forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.) I already mentioned how the
sun as a type went dark for the last three hours that Jesus was on the
cross and at one point will not shine in the tribulation as the people
choose the darkness of Satan over the light of Jesus. (Joel 2:10 The earth
shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon
shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:) When Jesus was
transfigured then his face shone like the sun. (Matthew 17:2 And was
transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his
raiment was white as the light.) When John saw Jesus in Revelation 1:16
then the countenance of Jesus was as the sun. (Revelation 1:16 And he had
in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged
sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.)
Countenance means face. The moon is a type of Christians that reflects the
light of the sun just as Christians as children of light are meant to
reflect the light of Jesus. Stars are represented in scripture as a type
of angels and just as Christians are supposed to reflect the light of
Jesus then so are angels. This is why as we saw in Joel 2:10 that when the
sun goes dark then the moon and stars must as well as they have no light
of Jesus to reflect. Notice that the moon is much brighter in the sky than
the stars. This is symbolic of how as Christians we are children of light
who are supposed to tell others about Jesus. Salvation is for man and so
God expects man to preach the gospel, not angels as they have no
salvation. This means that as Christians we should shine forth brighter
than angels to spread this most important message. Lucifer whose name
meant light bearer was originally created to shine forth the light of
Jesus, but he rejected that light and became darkness and was renamed
Satan. Another type in scripture as Jesus as the light of the world is
seen in the lamps that were placed in the tabernacle. These lamps were to
burn continuously just like we need the light of Jesus to burn
continually. Without the light of Jesus we would die in our sins and burn
for eternity in the lake of fire. These seven lamps were attached to a
candlestick that had twenty two bowls which fed these lamps. (Leviticus
24:2-4 2 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure
oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn
continually.                                                    
3 Without the vail of the testimony,
in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the
evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a
statute for ever in your
generations.                                                                  
4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD
continually.) These lamps were the only light allowed inside as no natural
light was allowed. This is symbolic of how only the light of Jesus can
save us and it is only the light of Jesus that we need to survive. We do
not need to rely on natural or artificial light. This is why we do not
worship the sun even though it is a type of Jesus. We only worship the
true light. The candlesticks that held the lamps were made of gold and
gold represents deity showing how the light inside them comes from God.
The Jewish feast of Hanukkah which is called the feast of the dedication
in scripture in John 10:22 is also known as the festival of lights. Notice
this is verse 22. Hanukkah is when Jesus was conceived as a man and
dedicated to the world as the light of the world so we see both names
apply. The feast of tabernacles had a major lighting ceremony on the last
day that shone throughout Jerusalem and it was here that Jesus said he was
the light of the world to show the people what the lighting ceremony was
meant to represent all these years as a type of him.

We saw how the sun as the greatest light in nature is a type of
Jesus. Lightning is another great light in nature. In nature there are
seven types of light. Seven represents perfection or completeness. This
fits in as God as light is perfect and complete. Light is electromagnetic
energy. Light has tremendous power that can be converted into weapons or
used for cooking such as seen in microwaves. God also is omnipotent or all
powerful. Light is the fastest known thing in existence and travels at
186,000 miles per second. The only thing in nature that light cannot
escape from is a black hole which is symbolic of hell where those there
will live forever in darkness without the light of Jesus. Light represents
the Godhead which makes sense since God is light and all three persons of
the Godhead are one. The seven types of light found in nature are from
longest to shortest wavelength radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible,
ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma rays. Notice that visible light is in the
middle or the fourth light from either direction. Four represents the
gospel and I have already shown how Jesus is the visible light of the
world and he is the gospel that must be preached to everyone. Visible
light itself is white light with white representing purity, but when split
it is divided into seven colors which are the colors of the rainbow. These
seven colors from longest to shortest wavelength are red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, and violet. All seven of these together make white
light. Colors as numbers in scripture have meaning and the seven colors of
the rainbow present the gospel with their meanings and order of the
colors. Color is vibration of light and sound is vibration of air. There
are seven musical notes which all have a corresponding color of the
rainbow. Light consists of three primary colors of red, green, and blue.
Red represents the shed blood of Jesus that he shed for the sins of the
world on the cross at Calvary. Green represents the life we have which God
the Holy Ghost breathed into us, and blue represents God the Father. Blue
means separation and God the Father is separated from all other false gods
as he is the God of gods. (Deuteronomy 10:17 For the LORD your God is God
of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which
regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:) We see that there are only
three primary colors since there are three persons in the Godhead. We also
see these are not the same primary colors as seen in paint of red, yellow,
and blue. Light as God is different. In paint the three colors still
represent God with the red of Jesus' blood, and the yellow of the deity of
God, and the blue of separation of God from all other gods. Primary colors
whether in light or paint when mixed make the three secondary colors.
Primary colors exist on their own and are not made from any other color
just like God who has always existed and is made by no one else. The three
primary colors of light of red, green, and blue when mixed together make
white light as it is pure like God, but when you combine the three primary
colors of paint you make black. The three primary colors of light make all
other colors just as God made everything. Light is the best analogy for
trying to understand the Godhead which consists of God the Father, God the
Son Jesus Christ, and God the Holy Ghost. God is one God in three persons
at the same time and God is light. This can be seen how when you mix the
three primary colors of light together you have one light which is white
light. This white light is made up of the colors of red, green, and blue
which all three exist at the same time, but are still only one white
light. We still refer to white light in the singular. The Godhead is the
same way as all three persons of the Godhead exist at the same time, but
are still only one God and light is the same way. People often try to show
the Godhead as how water can be a solid, liquid, or gas which is true, but
they cannot all three exist at the same time the way light can. I believe
it is best to compare the Godhead with scripture and how God compares
himself since God is light. I have to give credit to Dr. David A. Ball for
this analogy which I believe is the best one I have ever heard. The three
secondary colors of light are cyan, magenta, and yellow. Cyan is a mixture
of blue and green light. Magenta is a mixture of red and blue light and
yellow is a mixture of red and green light. The three primary colors in
paint are orange, green, and purple. Orange is a mixture of red and
yellow, green is a mixture of yellow and blue, and purple is a mixture of
red and blue. Light has many qualities that are like God which makes sense
since God is light. Light is unable to be touched and is uncreated. Light
always overcomes darkness. You take a candle and stick it in a pitch black
room and it will seem like a bright light. Light seems to be in multiple
places at once as you can see light in a distant room even if you cannot
see the light bulb as light is able to bend around obstacles. This shows
God's omnipresence. Light is unchanging and absolute just like God.
(Malachi 3:6 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob
are not consumed.) Light is pure just like God and all of creation relies
on light for survival. This applies to physical life, but especially to
the spiritual life of Jesus. People who are denied light, especially
sunlight for a long time will soon start developing many health problems
and psychological problems and they will soon lead to death. It is light
that allows plants by photosynthesis to produce food to live which the
plants then become food for all animals and people. All of these
attributes apply to both God and light. The seven types of light can all
be compared to the three persons of the Godhead. Light has different
properties that represent the Godhead. X-rays, gamma rays, radio waves,
and ultraviolet light cannot be seen or felt just as God the Father cannot
be seen or felt. Visible light can be seen and felt just as Jesus could be
seen and felt. Infrared light cannot be seen but can be felt as heat just
as the Holy Ghost cannot be seen but can be felt. Not sure on microwaves.
They too may represent the Holy Ghost. They are not seen and some say not
felt, but others say they can burn you, but they still may not be felt
before burning you. I am not sure. Just as light with the exception of
visible light cannot be seen, neither can God who is a Spirit. (John 4:24
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and
in truth.) Spirits are invisible unless God allows them to be seen just as
he allowed Jesus to be seen.    

I have shown how God is light especially Jesus who is the light of
the world. It is this light that gives us not only physical life, but
spiritual life. We see how nature with the seven types of light represent
the Godhead here on earth and how the sun represents Jesus and the rainbow
his salvation that he gives us. The sun is clearly visible for all to see
and so is God as his light shines all over the world so that people are
without excuse in rejecting the free gift of the light of God. Light in
nature is a wondrous and marvelous thing and so is the God who is light.
The next time we see light let it remind us of the Godhead and for those
who are still unsaved and living in darkness, then please turn from the
darkness and to the light and be saved. Seek the light so that you might
have everlasting life.
