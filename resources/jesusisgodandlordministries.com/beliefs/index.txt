Beliefs

Holy Bible (scripture)

The original scripture whether in Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek was
inspired, inerrant, and infallible. This means God spoke the words to men
and all of it was without error and true including punctuation. Copies
were made of the originals as they wore out and the originals no longer
exist. God has preserved his word in English in the King James Bible
(Authorized Version) which is also inspired, inerrant, infallible and all
of the punctuation and pilcrows [paragraph markings which properly end
with Acts 20:36] are correct and inspired. All of the scripture was given
to us in the 66 books of the King James Bible, no more and no less with
exactly the verses as in the King James Bible. The chapter and verse
numbers in the King James Bible are also inspired. The King James Bible is
scripture (word of God) and is the final authority on all matters. (II
Timothy 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness:)

God

God is one God in three persons (God the Father, God the Son [Jesus],
and God the Holy Ghost). This is known as the Godhead.

Jesus

Jesus is the second person in the Godhead and the only begotten Son
of God the Father. He as God has always existed. He is the Creator and
Sustainer of life and the universe. Jesus came to earth in the flesh as a
man to be the Saviour of mankind. He was born of the virgin Mary by the
Holy Ghost. Jesus lived a sinless and perfect life. He preached to the
lost, performed miracles, died on the cross for mine and your sins and the
sins of everyone who has or ever will live. Jesus gave his life for us. No
man took it. He was buried and rose again on the third day and is seated
at the right hand of God the Father. Jesus will return again for all those
who are saved and will reign for a literal thousand years as King of kings
and Lord of lords. (Millennium) Jesus is the Jewish Messiah. Jesus is the
Word of God.

Holy Ghost

The Holy Ghost is the third person of the Godhead and is just as much
God as God the Father and Jesus Christ. The Holy Ghost is the one who
convicts sinners of their need to be saved and to call upon Jesus to save
them. The Holy Ghost lives within believers.

Man

All people, whether male or female, rich or poor, Jew or Gentile, or
any other division are born with a sin nature because of the sin of Adam
and therefore must be saved (born again) to have eternal life. People must
call upon Jesus to save them. Man (Adam) was originally made of the dust
of the ground in the image of God with Eve made from one of Adam's ribs.
After the sin of Adam, all people today are now made in the image of Adam.
Man was made a triune being with a soul, spirit, and body. See Why we must
be born again.

Salvation

All mankind needs to be saved in order to have eternal life due to
the sin nature they are born with. One must admit they are a sinner in
need of a Saviour and must call upon Jesus to save them. Salvation is a
free gift from God that is received by faith alone. Works will not save
you or get you to heaven. All people will spend eternity in either heaven
or hell. The saved will be resurrected to heaven and the unsaved (lost) to
an eternal damnation in the lake of fire. (John 3:16 ¶ For God so loved
the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have everlasting life.) See What must I do to
be saved (be born again), have eternal life and go to heaven? If a person
is truly saved, they cannot lose their salvation. Jesus secures it
forever. Once saved, always saved.

Jews

The Jewish people are God's chosen people descendant from Abraham.
They are still a part of God's plan and have not been replaced by the
church. All Jews still need to be saved the same way as all Gentiles. The
Jews are the only people that have been promised a certain land. (Promised
Land) (Israel) One day all of it will be theirs. The Jews are the ones who
wrote the scripture and gave to us. Jesus was a Jew and is the Jewish
Messiah. Jews are to be prayed for and blessed. God said if you bless
Israel, he will bless you and if you curse Israel, he will curse you.
Israel has a right to exist.

Church

The church consists of all believers who are saved since the time of
Acts. The church is the people and not a building. All true believers
regardless of denomination are part of the church. The church is the bride
of Jesus. The church is responsible for spreading the gospel to win souls
and to teach all nations.

Earth

The earth is a special creation by God made for man. It is special
from all other planets. The earth is the only planet with life. The earth
was created a little less than six thousand years ago in six literal 24
hour days. Mother nature is not the earth, it is just nature and God the
Father. The earth is round and not flat. The earth is not to be
worshipped.
