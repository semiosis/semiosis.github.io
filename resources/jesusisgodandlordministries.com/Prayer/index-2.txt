Prayer

The first Sunday in November is International Day of Prayer for the
Persecuted Church or International Day of Prayer (IDOP) as it is usually
called. This is a day set aside each year by Christians to remember and
pray for persecuted Christians around the world.  

Prayer is one of the most powerful weapons that a Christian has along
with the word of God (scripture). Prayer is long reaching with a long
range and is long lasting. Every Christian can pray no matter how rich or
poor they are, where they live, how old they are, male or female, or
whether they are free or in bonds. Satan hates prayer warriors. Prayer
warriors are those Christians who are walking with God and are always
praying for their fellow Christians. For a person to be effective in their
prayer they first need to make sure they have no unconfessed sin and are
right with God. God will not listen when we have sin that we have not
confessed. Our prayers will be ineffective. The only prayer God will hear
from an unbeliever is the one when they ask Jesus to save them. God wants
all Christians to be prayer warriors though some people definitely have
the gift of compassion and caring more than others so they have more
effective prayers. When we pray we need to believe that what we pray for
will be answered by God. If we do not truly believe God can answer the
prayer than more than likely he will not. God will not answer those who
lack faith. (Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye
desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have
them.) When we pray we need to pray in Jesus' name for it to be effective
and he will answer the prayer. Jesus himself said he would. (John 14:13-14
And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father
may be glorified in the Son.
14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.) Now this verse
does not mean we can ask for something that we know is a sin or against
God's will as God will not answer that prayer. God will answer Christian's
prayers, though it will be in his timing and his way and according to his
will. Sometimes God will answer yes and sometimes he will answer no and
sometimes he makes us wait. We may be praying for a loved one who is lost,
but it may take 50 years for God to answer that prayer. Other times we may
be praying for a certain job, but God will say no as he has an even better
job planned for you and sometimes he will answer yes right away. A
Christian is to just pray and not worry about how God will answer the
prayer. Sometimes when we pray for a sick and dying Christian, God will
heal them up and other times he will take them home to be with him.
Sometimes by taking them home is the answer to our prayers. We pray and
ask God to heal them and this is the best way to heal them as now they are
pain free and with God. We are never to argue with God over the answers to
our prayers. Sometimes God will never reveal to us the answer to our
prayers directly such as when Job was asking God what he did wrong to
deserve his punishment. God never revealed to Job that he was allowing
Satan to test him, but rather blessed him with a double portion at the end
of the test. This was mainly because Job stayed faithful to God during the
whole ordeal.

God wants all Christians to be prayer warriors. We are always to be
in prayer. (I Thessalonians 5:17 Pray without ceasing.) We as Christians
need to pray about everything. We should pray and ask the blessing on our
food before we eat including in a public place. Do not be ashamed of God.
Too many Christians eat without praying just like an animal and are not
even thankful for the food God provides for them. God said if we pray over
our food it will be sanctified and this is why we can eat even the unclean
foods that the Israelites were not allowed to eat. (I Timothy 4:4-5 For
every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be
received with thanksgiving:
5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.) Jesus prayed before
eating such as when he fed the five thousand and the four thousand.
(Matthew 14:19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass,
and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he
blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the
disciples to the multitude.) (Matthew 15:36 And he took the seven loaves
and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his
disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.) Jesus also prayed before
the last supper just before going to the cross. (Matthew 26:26-27 ¶ And as
they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and
gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
saying, Drink ye all of it;) Jesus was a prayer warrior who was always
praying to God the Father. Shortly before his death, Jesus prayed for
himself, his apostles and for all of those who would become Christians in
the future. (John 17:5 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own
self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.) (John
17:9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou
hast given me; for they are thine.) (John 17:20 Neither pray I for these
alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;)
Jesus wants us as Christians to stay in the world to tell others about
Jesus, but not to be a part of the world. Jesus prayed this for his
apostles and disciples. (John 17:15 I pray not that thou shouldest take
them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.)
As I mentioned before God may not always answer our prayer the way we
want. A persecuted Christian may pray for the safety of their life, but
God may still allow Satan to take their life if it is God's will for his
purpose. By taking that life, many people might be saved. It is similar to
praying for a sick baby. God may allow that child to die so the nurses and
physicians may be saved when they never would have otherwise and that
child is home with God. Many other times in Jesus' life he prayed. He
often went to the garden of Gethsemane to pray. Sometimes he went up to
the mountain and prayed all night and other times he got up early before
sunrise to pray. (Matthew 14:23 And when he had sent the multitudes away,
he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come,
he was there alone.) Jesus would start his day off with prayer. We as
Christians need to follow the example of Jesus and pray when we rise, for
our meals, and throughout the day. A person can pray while driving or
while at work, but a prayer warrior will have time dedicated just for
prayer. Jesus said to go in a closet and pray. Now I do not believe you
literally need to be in a closet, but you do need a place where you are
undisturbed and alone with God such as how Jesus went up into the mountain
to be alone. (Matthew 6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy
closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in
secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.)
Sometimes it is necessary for a Christian to spend all day or night in
prayer just like Jesus depending on the prayer request. Some prayer
requests such as casting out devils require not only prayer, but fasting
as well. (Matthew 17:21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and
fasting.) As a prayer warrior we are told after putting on the whole
armour of God to pray always for all saints and with perseverance.
(Ephesians 6:18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the
Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for
all saints;) The prayer warrior will not give up until their prayer is
answered yes. Too many Christians never pray for anything let alone spend
hours in prayer then they wonder why God is not close to them. If they do
pray they only pray once and then give up. Prayer is nothing more than
talking to God. The Holy Ghost will help us with our prayers when we do
not know what to say for he knows what we need. (Romans 8:26 Likewise the
Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray
for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with
groanings which cannot be uttered.) God said to make our requests before
him by prayer. (Philippians 4:6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing
by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made
known unto God.) We pray with our spirit. Our spirit is the part that
worships God. (I Corinthians 14:15 What is it then? I will pray with the
spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the
spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.)   

We are told in James that when a Christian is sick to have the elders
of the church pray over him and anoint them with oil. These verses also
show how prayer of the faith will save the sick. We also see how God
answered Elijah's prayer to withhold rain. (James 5:13-18 Is any among you
afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and
let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise
him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye
may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth
much.
17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the
space of three years and six months.
18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought
forth her fruit.) Notice verse 16 says the "effectual fervent prayer of a
righteous man availeth much". This is your prayer warrior. This shows how
God will hear the righteous person who is never ending in their prayer and
how this kind of prayer is effective. This shows how for a prayer to be
effective, the one praying needs to have God forgive their sins first
before he will hear their prayer. We must be like the lady in the movie
War Room that stays in the fight with prayer. Remember we are fighting a
spiritual battle and prayer is a vital necessity in order for victory.
Prayer should be the first thing Christians reach for rather than the last
thing as most Christians tend to do. Christians often try to do everything
themselves first and then turn to God when we should be turning to God
first. God should be our first line of defense. We are to pray for those
Christians in bonds. (Hebrews 13:3 Remember them that are in bonds, as
bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also
in the body.)

As Christians we need to pray for each other to be bold to witness
for Jesus. Paul even asked for prayer for him to be bold and have
opportunities to pray and said we are to continue in prayer. Too many
Christians pray once or twice and then they give up when they feel God has
not answered their prayer. We are to continue in prayer. (Colossians 4:2-3
Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
3 Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of
utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:)

When men pray they are not to have their head covered. This is one
reason that men should never wear a hat in church. (I Corinthians 11:4
Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth
his head.)

Jesus taught the people how to pray during his sermon on the mount in
Matthew 6:9-15. This is often referred to as the Lord's Prayer though I
believe the prayers I mentioned of Jesus praying in John 17 should be the
Lord's Prayer. Jesus taught us in Matthew 6 that we are to pray to God the
Father in Jesus' name. We do not pray to Mary or anyone else. We get to
God the Father by Jesus only. Today the military and many others are
trying to prohibit praying in Jesus' name. A prayer is only effective when
we pray in Jesus' name otherwise there is no point in praying. Jesus also
taught his disciples how to pray when they asked. It should be noted that
they did want to know how to pray. We should too. Too many Christians
today do not care about praying and never do. (Luke 11:1 And it came to
pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of
his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught
his disciples.) The rest of the prayer is found in Luke 11:2-4. Jesus
taught all people that when we pray we are not to pray using vain
repetitions as do the heathen or for example the Roman Catholics, Jews,
and Muslims. God will not hear those prayers. We are to pray from the
heart, not some memorized words. (Matthew 6:7-8 But when ye pray, use not
vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be
heard for their much speaking.
8Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things
ye have need of, before ye ask him.) We see here how God the Father just
as the Holy Ghost already knows what we need before we pray. Notice the
verse says the things we need, not the things we want. Too many Christians
pray for things thing want such as a new boat or car, but they do not need
them. God will make sure his children have what they need, but not all
will get the things they want.

Jesus also commands us to pray for our enemies and for those who
persecute us. This is not easy, but we need to pray for them so they might
be saved. If they are saved they will no longer be our enemies. Much
greater persecution is coming to the United States of America so we need
to heed God's words. Jesus prayed for his enemies and we must as well.
Many Christians around the world pray for their enemies everyday as they
are beaten and imprisoned and some killed. (Matthew 5:44 But I say unto
you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that
hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute
you;)

We need to pray that God will send many people to try and win souls.
(Matthew 9:37-38 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is
plenteous, but the labourers are few;
38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth
labourers into his harvest.) Let us always pray for missionaries as well
as those pastors and preachers who preach God's word. Pray for me. We need
to pray for the lost.

God over the years has healed many people of their illnesses such as
cancer and he will continue if Christians continue in prayer. I have
personally seen the power of prayer many times not only in healing of
people, but in answer to many other prayer requests.

God said that we have access to his riches and power. Jesus said he
could call down twelve legions of angels if he chose. (Matthew 26:53
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently
give me more than twelve legions of angels?) God will protect us with the
same. Just as God protected Job with a hedge around his house and family
he will do the same for those prayer warriors that love him. Jack Chick
had a former witch who was a Satanist who got saved tell him about the
time when Satan wanted him killed and sent many witches and devils to his
house only to be blocked by a large amount of angels protecting Jack and
his house. Missionaries have also told stories of protection. 

Prayer is a must for Christians as this is how we talk to God. All
Christians should want to pray so they can talk to God. We all need to
learn to become prayer warriors and pray for each other and all Christians
and for the lost and their salvation. God answers prayers and Satan knows
this and this is why he hates praying Christians. Prayer is the most
powerful weapon a Christian has against Satan and we need to start using
it. Remember to pray many times every day and for every aspect of your
life. There is nothing too insignificant for God that he does not want you
to come to him in prayer. The more we pray the stronger a Christian we
will become and more hated of Satan. Become a prayer warrior today and
keep Satan at bay.
