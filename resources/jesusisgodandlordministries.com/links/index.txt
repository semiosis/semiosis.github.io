Links

The following links are helpful for King James Bibles and other sources as
well as other helpful information from Christian ministries. These links
are to be helpful for Christians or those interested in knowing more, as
well as to help support other ministries. I get no money in return and
they do not even know I added their links. I do not necessarily agree with
everything sold or written by the links, but overall they are very good.
One example is I believe the Institute of Creation Research should only
use the King James Bible, but they do have a very good daily Bible reading
devotional called Days of Praise that is King James Bible and is free as
well as they have great resources showing evolution is false. Please
notify me of any links not working at
kevin@jesusisgodandlordministries.com. Thank you.

King James Bible:

great YouTube videos.)

and promote the King James Bible as the preserved word of God. They have

great soul winning ministry. They always need prayers and money, but use
the money wisely with great results.

for my eternal destiny. May God bless them both and reward them in
eternity.)

This film was produced by Creation Today [A ministry promoting a young
earth. Unfortunately they do not use the King James Bible.]) 

https://www.swordofthelord.com/ Sword of the Lord Ministries has a great
newspaper called the Sword of the Lord Newspaper that they sell that is
available at their website. This ministry is a King James Ministry and is
independent Baptist. They have many great articles in their newspaper and
sell a hymnal and many books. 

Links for great places for Christians to visit with their families:

Dinosaur Adventure Land (drdino.com) Dinosaur Adventure Land is free and
located in Lenox, Alabama. It is a park that is part of Dr. Kent Hovind's
ministry Creation Science Evangelism. It teaches people about the gospel
through science. All is taught from a Biblical view and discredits the
false evolution theory. It is meant to be a fun soul winning park.
Promotes the true young earth creationism as taught in scripture. Dr. Kent
Hovind teaches a Bible study every night for those who want to stay and
listen. He uses the King James Bible. His great Bible studies can also be
viewed on YouTube. Park does have some camping spots available and has
some zoo animals. The park has a good bookstore to buy good resources.
Donations are accepted and appreciated. I have not yet had the privilege
of visiting this place personally, but I know Dr. Kent Hovind is a sincere
soul winning Christian who loves the Lord and I know this place will be
well worth it. Dr. Hovind has a YouTube video showing the park.

https://creationmuseum.org/ The Creation Museum is a part of the ministry
of Ken Ham's Answers in Genesis located in Petersburg, Kentucky. The
Creation Museum promotes the Biblical view of a young earth creation. It
shows the falsehood and dangers of evolution. They present the gospel. The
museum also has a planetarium, zoo (includes a zorse [horse and zebra] and
zonkey [zebra and donkey (ass)] showing how the ark contained kinds, not
species), botanical gardens, and a zipline. Unfortunately it does not use
the King James Bible for scripture verses. The Creation Museum is a short
distance from Cincinnati, Ohio. It has a sister museum, the Ark Encounter
about Noah's ark.

https://arkencounter.com/ The Ark Encounter is a Christian theme park that
has a life size replica of Noah's Ark according to the dimensions given in
scripture. (510 feet long, 85 feet wide, and 51 feet high) It is also a
ministry of Ken Ham's Answers in Genesis which also operates the Creation
Museum. There is also a zoo and a zipline at the Ark Encounter. It is
located in Williamstown, Kentucky about 40 minutes drive (45 miles) from
the Creation Museum. The Ark Encounter promotes a true Biblical view of a
young earth creation. They present the gospel. Unfortunately the King
James Bible is not used for scripture verses. Ken Ham has some excellent
books such as One Blood showing how all people come from one blood whether
white, black, brown, red or yellow or any other color. Another good book
by Ken Ham is The Great Dinosaur Mystery Solved showing how dinosaurs are
mentioned in scripture and walked with man. Unfortunately he does not use
the King James Bible in his books. His books may be found in the bookstore
here or at the Creation Museum.

https://discoverycenter.icr.org/ The Discovery Center for Science and
Earth History is located in Dallas, Texas and is a ministry of the
Institute of Creation Research. This museum promotes the true Biblical
view of a young earth creation and shows how evolution is false and
dangerous. The museum contains a section on Adam and Eve, the Genesis
flood, tower of Babel, and the Ice Age. (There was only one ice age, not
many as the evolutionists promote.) There is also a planetarium at the
museum. They present the gospel. Unfortunately they do not use the King
James Bible for scripture verses.

https://holylandexperience.com The Holy Land Experience is a Christian
theme park located in Orlando, Florida. It has shows and contains a small
model of Jerusalem that is interesting to see. It has a replica of the
temple and other interesting sites. I do not agree with everything at the
park, but overall is a place worth visiting. Has a fun rock climbing wall
for children and adults. Unfortunately they do not use the King James
Bible for scripture verses.

https://www.canyonministries.org/ Every Christian should try to see the
wonders of the Grand Canyon, located in Arizona and hike to the bottom if
they are able. The canyon clearly shows how the Genesis flood rapidly
created the Grand Canyon in a short time (probably only months or a few
years and not over millions of years as evolutionist's say. The "little
Grand Canyon" formed in six days after Mount St. Helens exploded showing
how rapidly canyons can form.) Canyon Ministries offers tours of the Grand
Canyon and the Colorado River and explains everything from a Biblical view
of the creation of the Grand Canyon rapidly due to the Genesis flood. I
have been to the Grand Canyon and hiked it, but I have not personally been
on a tour with this ministry, but hear that it is very good. Unfortunately
as best I can tell, they do not use the King James Bible for scripture
verses.
