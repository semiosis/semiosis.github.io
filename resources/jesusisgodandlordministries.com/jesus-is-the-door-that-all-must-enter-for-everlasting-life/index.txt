Jesus is the door that all must enter for everlasting life

Jesus is the door that all must enter through for eternal life. Jesus
is the only door. There is no other door that a person may enter for
eternal life. The Holy Bible has several types representative of Jesus as
the door for everlasting life.

The first type in scripture is the door on Noah's ark. Genesis 6-9
tells of the story of the global flood of Noah's day [it was global unlike
how many people believe it was a local flood] and how God commanded Noah
to build an ark. The people of the world had become so wicked and had been
corrupted by the angels who reproduced with women producing the giants
that God wished he had never made man on the earth. Noah was a just man
and had found grace in God's eyes. (Genesis 6:4-8 4 There were giants in
the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in
unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the
same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

5¶ And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually.
6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it
grieved him at his heart.
7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face
of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls
of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.) God decided to save Noah
and those who would repent and listen to Noah's preaching. God commanded
Noah to build an ark 300 cubits long by 50 cubits wide by 30 cubits tall.
Most people say this is 450 feet long by 75 feet wide and 45 feet tall
based on an 18 inch cubit, but I believe there is evidence to show it was
most likely built based on the royal cubit of 20.6 inches making the ark
515 feet long by 86 feet wide by 51.5 feet tall [156.9 meters long by 26.2
meters wide by 15.6 meters tall]. The ark was to be built with only one
door and God said that only those on the ark would survive the flood. Noah
was to bring animals on the ark and his wife, three sons and their wives.
Anyone else that called on God for salvation could also enter the ark and
be saved, but all ignored the plea and warning and perished. (Genesis
6:15-16 15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length
of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits,
and the height of it thirty cubits.
16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish
it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.) There
was only one door on the ark as it represented that there is only one door
in Jesus for salvation. Those outside the ark perished and those inside
the ark were saved. God himself closed the door and was in the ark with
Noah and his family. (Genesis 7:16 And they that went in, went in male and
female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.)
Jesus is always with those who enter the door through him as he lives
within them. God called Noah and his family into the ark and he calls all
people to come to him today for salvation. (Genesis 7:1 And the LORD said
unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen
righteous before me in this generation.) There was only one door that
could save those on earth at that time and that was the single door of the
ark. Just as Noah and his family entered through one door to be saved, so
must everyone also enter only one door in Jesus to be saved. Jesus
provided mercy to Noah and his family even in his time of judgment on the
earth and he will provide mercy today to all of those who call upon Jesus
to save them.  

Just before God sent the last of the ten plagues on Egypt, God
commanded the Israelites to sacrifice an unblemished lamb and to spread
the lamb's blood on the top and sides of the door posts that went into
their houses. This instituted the feast of passover. (Exodus 12:5 Your
lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall
take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:) (Exodus 12:7 And they
shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the
upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.) If an Israelite
obeyed the command then when the angel passed over the door, those inside
the house would live, but if the blood was not there the tenth plague of
the death of the firstborn would apply to that house just as it would to
the Egyptians. (Exodus 12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token
upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over
you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the
land of Egypt.) This passover door was a type of the door of Jesus. The
lamb without blemish that was sacrificed was a type of the sinless Jesus
who was our passover lamb and was called the Lamb of God. (I Corinthians
5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye
are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:) (John
1:29 ¶ The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold
the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.) (II Corinthians
5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might
be made the righteousness of God in him.) The blood on the door posts was
in the shape of a cross and represented the fact that only the blood of
Jesus that he shed for us on the cross of Calvary will wash away our sins.
The cross was the door that allowed man to be reconciled with Jesus and
opened the door to eternal life. Just as the Israelites who obeyed God's
command were spared the tenth plague and the death of the firstborn, those
who obey God and call upon Jesus to save them will be saved. The
Israelites had only one passover door, just as Jesus is the only door for
salvation.

The door [vail] in the temple and the tabernacle that entered into
the holy of holies was a type of Jesus. There was only one door into the
holy of holies. The holy of holies was a place that only the high priest
could enter and only once a year on the day of atonement [known as Yom
Kippur today] which was on the tenth day of the seventh month [normally
September, but sometimes October]. Yom Kippur is considered the holiest
day of the year by Jews, even by Jews who are not religious. On this day
the high priest had to make a sacrifice for himself [a bull] and for the
nation of Israel [a goat]. (Leviticus 16:11 And Aaron shall bring the
bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an
atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of
the sin offering which is for himself:) (Leviticus 16:15 ¶ Then shall he
kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his
blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of
the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy
seat:) The blood had to be placed upon the mercy seat which was located on
the top of the ark of the covenant. This blood sacrifice allowed the
peoples sins to be covered by the blood for forgiveness for the year by
God's mercy and was symbolic of the future sacrifice of Jesus on the
cross. This blood did not save the people, but pointed to Jesus and his
death on the cross. When Jesus shed his blood for us on the cross, it no
longer covered our sins, but washed them away for all of those who enter
the door of Jesus by confessing they are a sinner in need of Jesus as
their Saviour and call upon him to save them. After the high priest
finished the sacrifice for himself and the people, he released a second
goat into the wilderness. The high priest had two goats and had cast lots
to see which one was sacrificed to the LORD and which one was the
scapegoat. This scapegoat that was released into the wilderness
represented the removal of Israel's sins that were carried away never to
return. I believe it may be that the two goats are also representative of
the old and new testaments with the sacrificed goat representing the old
testament and the sacrifices which covered our sins and the law how it
only pointed out to you that you were a sinner in need of a Saviour, but
could not save you. The scapegoat represented the new testament with it
representing Jesus carrying away our sins as far as the east is from the
west as the shed blood of Jesus washes our sins away never to be
remembered by God just as the sins on the scapegoat were never returned to
Israel. (Leviticus 16:10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the
scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement
with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.) The high
priest could enter the holy of holies only through one door and only after
the blood sacrifice of an animal. People can only enter heaven through the
door of Jesus and only after accepting him as Saviour and his blood
sacrifice for us. Unlike the "door" of the holy of holies which only the
high priest could enter and only one day of the year, the door of Jesus
can be entered every day of the year by anyone who calls upon him to save
them.  

The sheep gate (door) is represented by Jesus. Jesus is the good
shepherd and the chief Shepherd and we are his sheep. (John 10:11 I am the
good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.) (I Peter
5:4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of
glory that fadeth not away.) People are referred to as sheep by Jesus.
Sheep are dumb animals and they need a leader. This is why everyone needs
Jesus who is the great shepherd. (Hebrews 13:20 Now the God of peace, that
brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the
sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,) At night the
shepherd would put his sheep in a sheepfold and he would sleep in front of
the opening and thus was the door. Jesus as our shepherd said he was the
door of the sheep. (John 10:7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.) People (sheep) need
to pass through the door of Jesus for safety and salvation. There is no
other door that one can enter for everlasting life. Jesus said that anyone
who tried to enter through another door, such as by doing good works as in
Roman Catholicism and all false religions, or who tried to lead others
through another door, was a thief and a robber. (John 10:1 Verily, verily,
I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but
climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.) (John 10:8
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did
not hear them.) Jesus said the thief cometh to kill and destroy. (John
10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:
I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more
abundantly.) Jesus came not to destroy, but to save his sheep. (John 10:9
I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go
in and out, and find pasture.) Anyone who will call upon the Shepherd with
sincerity to save them will be saved. All sheep (people) must enter
through the door of the great Shepherd, the Lord Jesus Christ for
salvation. Those who enter the door of Jesus who is the great Shepherd
will find pasture in heaven. 

The strait (narrow) gate which means narrow is the narrow way and is
the only way to Jesus. Jesus himself said this in Matthew 7:13-14.
(Matthew 7:13-14 13 ¶ Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the
gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be
which go in thereat:

14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto
life, and few there be that find it.) Most people want to take the broad
way which will lead to destruction, death, and eternity in hell and the
lake of fire. Jesus said the narrow way was the only way to find life, but
few would find it. All false religions as well as even many Christian
denominations and cults such as Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy,
Mormonism, and Jehovah's Witnesses all lead their people on the broad way
through the wide gate by saying there are many ways to heaven such as by
works, through Allah, Buddha, Mary, the pope, Baptism, or any of a dozen
other ways. They all teach that a person can get to heaven without calling
upon Jesus to save them, but Jesus says otherwise that only he is the door
to eternal life and it is by the strait (narrow) gate. (Ephesians 2:8-9 8
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.)  

The stone door in front of the tomb of Jesus proved no obstacle to
his resurrection. Jesus as God was able to pass through that door with no
problem even though it was intended to keep his body inside. (Mark 15:46
And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen,
and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a
stone unto the door of the sepulchre.) Jesus as our resurrected Saviour
was able to overcome death and defeat Satan by rising from the dead and
passing through that door to allow all people who receive him as Saviour
to be able to pass through the door of death as well.

Now is the time to call upon Jesus for salvation, as the day will
come when the door of Jesus is shut and it will be eternally too late.
Jesus said in (Luke 13:24-27 24 ¶ Strive to enter in at the strait gate:
for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

25When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the
door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying,
Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you
not whence ye are:

26 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence,
and thou hast taught in our streets.
27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from
me, all ye workers of iniquity.) Many will come knocking on the door, but
Jesus will have it shut never to be open for them again. I am sure this
happened to people during the flood of Noah's day, but the door of the ark
was closed and it was too late for those on the outside. The same applies
today for those who continue to reject Jesus as their Saviour. The day
will come when they are no longer convicted by the Holy Ghost and will not
be allowed to be saved as they have hardened their heart to the point of
no return. In the parable of the ten virgins as told by Jesus in Matthew
25, we see that the five unwise virgins had the door shut on them as they
went to get oil for their lamps since they were not prepared for his
coming. (Matthew 25:10-13 10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom
came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the
door was shut.
11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the
Son of man cometh.) Once the door was shut by Jesus, it was too late for
the five unwise virgins who missed the bridegroom of Jesus. Do not be like
these unwise virgins who were not prepared, but be saved before the door
is shut. Once you die the door is shut and it is too late if you have
never entered the door of Jesus. Once you are dead, you can no longer be
saved.

When we preach the gospel of Jesus to the lost in a dying world, we
open the door of Jesus to them. May we give them the gospel while we can
and while there is still time. This can be as simple as giving them a
gospel tract. Paul prayed that God would open the door for him to preach
the gospel. (Colossians 4:3 Withal praying also for us, that God would
open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for
which I am also in bonds:) God will open the door to those who are sincere
in trying to reach the lost for Jesus. Jesus himself knocks at the door of
every person wanting them to let him come into them as their Saviour. For
those who truly seek to enter the door of Jesus, Jesus will always allow
you to enter. (Revelation 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if
any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will
sup with him, and he with me.) No man can shut the door of the true church
or of the gospel though many have tried. No man can shut the door of Jesus
and neither can Satan. Only Jesus can shut the door. (Revelation 3:8 I
know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man
can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and
hast not denied my name.) Everyone ever born is a sinner on a path to
death and must decide on their own to choose to enter through the door of
Jesus or not. (Romans 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the
glory of God;) (Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of
God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.) If there is anyone
here today or anyone who is listening to this video that is not saved,
please open the door of Jesus today so that you might have everlasting
life. Jesus is the only door to everlasting life and no other door will
give you life.
