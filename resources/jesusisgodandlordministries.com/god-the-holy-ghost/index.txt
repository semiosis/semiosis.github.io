God the Holy Ghost

Most if not all of you have probably never heard a sermon on God the
Holy Ghost. I do not recall ever hearing one in my lifetime though I may
just do not remember it.

The Holy Ghost is the third person of the Godhead and fully equal
with the other two persons. The Holy Ghost is just as much God as God the
Father or God the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. The Holy Ghost is masculine
gender just as the other two persons are. He is not female and is not
neutral or genderless. He is always referred to in the masculine gender
just as the other two members of the Godhead. The Holy Ghost is referred
to also just as Spirit in scripture as well as Comforter. The Holy Ghost
is the Comforter sent by Jesus. Only once is he referred to as the Holy
Spirit, though six other times he is referred to as holy Spirit showing he
is holy. (Luke 11:13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts
unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy
Spirit to them that ask him?) I believe Holy Spirit more refers to his
position whereas Holy Ghost is his name. The Holy Ghost is a person, not a
force as taught by some cults such as the Jehovah's Witnesses. They
actually have force for Spirit in Genesis 1:2 of their bible. Roman
Catholicism which is another cult, in some Roman Catholic bibles such as
the New American Bible (NAB) and the New Jerusalem Bible (NJB) have mighty
wind or divine wind for Spirit in Genesis 1:2. Some other corrupt bibles
that have been influenced by the Roman Catholic Church have a wind from
God or something similar in this verse such as the NRSV (New Revised
Standard Version). These changes deny the deity of the Holy Ghost and
denies him as part of the Godhead. The Holy Ghost is invisible and is
compared to the wind, but this was God the Holy Ghost hovering over the
water during creation, not just the wind. (John 3:8 The wind bloweth where
it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence
it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the
Spirit.) Corrupt bibles will also often use a lower case spirit for Spirit
or remove Spirit altogether. This denies the deity of God the Holy Ghost.
The Holy Ghost is also represented by the dove, a peaceful bird just as
the Holy Ghost brings peace to people by leading them to Jesus as seen at
the baptism of Jesus. (Luke 3:22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily
shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou
art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.) The Holy Ghost is not a
dove, but a person. The Holy Ghost has the characteristics of a person
just as much as God the Father or Jesus does. He speaks, hears, and
teaches us the truth. (John 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is
come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself;
but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you
things to come.) The Holy Ghost usually speaks through people unlike the
audible voice of Jesus or occasionally God the Father. Sometimes he speaks
to us Christians by what we say is our conscience and not to commit a sin.
That is the Holy Ghost speaking to you and telling you not to sin. Other
times the Holy Ghost would tell someone to do something for him such as
speak to an individual about Jesus. Here are some other verses that show
that the Holy Ghost speaks. (Acts 8:29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip,
Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.) (Acts 10:19 ¶ While Peter
thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek
thee.) (Acts 1:16 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been
fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before
concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.) The Holy Ghost
speaks to the churches. (Revelation 2:7 He that hath an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I
give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of
God.) The churches need to listen when the Holy Ghost speaks to them.

The Holy Ghost teaches us. The Holy Ghost is the one who wrote
scripture so he knows what it means and how to properly interpret it. When
we study God's word we should always pray and ask the Holy Ghost to teach
us and give us an understanding of what we are reading. The Holy Ghost
used holy godly men to actually write the scriptures though he spoke it to
them. This is why all scripture is inspired or God breathed as the Holy
Ghost is God. (II Peter 1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the
will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost.) (II Timothy 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and
is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness:) Scripture should be where our doctrine comes from
unlike in Roman Catholicism and other cults that get their doctrine from
Tradition or some manmade writing. The Holy Ghost gives us our doctrine.
Preachers need to preach what the Holy Ghost teaches us and not what man
teaches them. (I Corinthians 2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the
words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth;
comparing spiritual things with spiritual.) The Holy Ghost is the
Comforter that was sent by Jesus after his resurrection in order to have
God with us and in order to teach us. The Holy Ghost will comfort those
who are Christians if we let him. (John 14:26 But the Comforter, which is
the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you
all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have
said unto you.) This verse also shows how the Holy Ghost reminds us of
scripture, but we must first learn the scripture so that he can bring it
to our memory. The Holy Ghost reveals things to people. (Luke 2:26 And it
was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death,
before he had seen the Lord's Christ.) (Ephesians 3:5 Which in other ages
was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his
holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;)

We can grieve the Holy Ghost. We do this by sinning and also by
rejecting Jesus as one's Saviour. This means to offend, displease, or
provoke the Holy Ghost. (Ephesians 4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of
God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.) We can vex (make
angry) the Holy Ghost. (Isaiah 63:10 ¶ But they rebelled, and vexed his
holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought
against them.)

The Holy Ghost reasons or thinks. (Acts 15:28 For it seemed good to
the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these
necessary things;)

The Holy Ghost can be lied to and tempted. (Acts 5:3 But Peter said,
Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and
to keep back part of the price of the land?) (Acts 5:9 Then Peter said
unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of
the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at
the door, and shall carry thee out.)

The Holy Ghost has knowledge and is omniscient (all knowing) as a
member of the Godhead. (I Corinthians 2:10-11 But God hath
revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things,
yea, the deep things of God.
11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which
is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
God.) This verse shows the Spirit of God knows the things of God and as
God he is omniscient.

The Holy Ghost lives and dwells in believers. This shows he is
omnipresent (everywhere at once) as he is in all believers all over the
world at the same time. (II Timothy 1:14 That good thing which was
committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.) (I
Corinthians 6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the
Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your
own?) A person receives the Holy Ghost, who indwells them, the moment that
they are saved by asking Jesus to be their Saviour. This is known as the
baptism of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost on Pentecost made a sound like
the rushing mighty wind and appeared to the disciples of Jesus as cloven
tongues like as of fire. (Acts 2:1-4 And when the day of Pentecost was
fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind,
and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat
upon each of them.
4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with
other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.)

The Holy Ghost is omnipotent (all powerful) as he raised Jesus from
the dead after his death on the cross for our sins. (Romans 8:11 But if
the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that
raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
his Spirit that dwelleth in you.) As part of the Godhead he also created
us and gave us life. (Job 33:4 The Spirit of God hath made me, and the
breath of the Almighty hath given me life.) It was the Holy Ghost who
first breathed into Adam to give him life and make him a living soul.
(Genesis 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.) The Holy Ghost was at the very beginning of the creation showing
his eternal existence as God. He hovered over the water. (Genesis 1:2 And
the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of
the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.) The
Holy Ghost is the one who came upon Mary and impregnated her with Jesus.
He did this supernaturally, not physically as some cults such as Mormonism
teach how Mary was impregnated. This was necessary so that Jesus would be
born of a virgin and not with a sin nature so he could be the Saviour of
mankind without needing a Saviour for himself. This shows the omnipotence
of the Holy Ghost to impregnate a girl and she remains a virgin. This
child Jesus was holy and was the God-man. (Luke 1:35 And the angel
answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing
which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.) (Matthew
1:18-23 18 ¶ Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was
found with child of the Holy Ghost.
19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her
a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not
to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of
the Holy Ghost.
21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:
for he shall save his people from their sins.
22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of
the Lord by the prophet, saying,
23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and
they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with
us.)

The Holy Ghost appoints people to be pastors, not man. (Acts 20:28 ¶
Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which
the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which
he hath purchased with his own blood.)

The Holy Ghost can be blasphemed. This is the only sin that will not
be forgiven by God. The Holy Ghost is the one who points us to Jesus, so
by blaspheming the Holy Ghost the person is rejecting Jesus. (Matthew
12:31-32 ¶ Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall
be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not
be forgiven unto men.
32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be
forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not
be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.)
These verses also applied to a special case of blasphemy of the Holy Ghost
by the Pharisees who saw Jesus doing miracles by the power of the Holy
Ghost, but said Jesus was doing them by devils. To attribute the work of
the Holy Ghost to Satan is unforgiveable. A saved person cannot blasphemy
the Holy Ghost.

The Holy Ghost is often neglected. I mentioned how few sermons are
done on the Holy Ghost and few books are written about him. Few hymns are
written and sung about him. Francis Chan wrote a book on the Holy Ghost
titled Forgotten God: Reversing Our Tragic Neglect of the Holy Spirit.
Francis called the Holy Ghost the forgotten God and neglected. This is
partially intentional by the Holy Ghost. The main purpose of the Holy
Ghost is to point people to Jesus and bring glory to Jesus, not himself.
The Holy Ghost is the one who convicts people that they are a sinner and
of their need for Jesus as their Saviour. (Romans 3:23 For all have
sinned, and come short of the glory of God;) (Romans 6:23 For the wages of
sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
Lord.) A person will not get saved no matter what we tell them until the
Holy Ghost convicts them. (John 16:8-9 And when he is come, he will
reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
9 Of sin, because they believe not on me;) The Holy Ghost invites people
to Jesus. (Revelation 22:17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And
let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.) After a person is
saved, it is the Holy Ghost who convicts them when they sin and compels
them to confess their sin. The Holy Ghost helps a Christian when they pray
on what to say. The Holy Ghost will intercede on behalf of the Christian.
(Romans 8:26-27 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we
know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according
to the will of God.) The Holy Ghost will tell Christians to invite people
or to go with them so they may hear about Jesus. (Acts 11:12 And the
Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren
accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:) We are told to hear
what the Holy Ghost has to say to the churches. Seven times in Revelation
2-3 he says to hear what he says to the churches. (Revelation 3:6 He that
hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.) Let
this be a warning to all people, but especially Christians. We are told
that he who has an ear to listen as faith cometh by hearing the word of
God. (Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the
word of God.) A person can reject the conviction of the Holy Ghost to be
saved by Jesus only so many times. It will come to the point that their
heart is hardened and they can never be saved even if they want to be.

The Holy Ghost will bear witness of Jesus and testify of Jesus as
well as whether a person is a true Christian or not. (John 15:26 But when
the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the
Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of
me:) (Romans 8:16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that
we are the children of God:) (I John 5:6-8 This is he that came by water
and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.
And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word,
and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the
water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.) A true Christian
should show the fruit of the Spirit. (Galatians 5:22-23 But the fruit of
the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith,
23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.) A person can only
call Jesus Lord by the Holy Ghost which shows they are a true Christian
and when speaking by the Holy Ghost can never curse Jesus. This is a test
to pick out fraudulent preachers and cultic leaders. (I Corinthians 12:3
Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of
God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the
Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.)

The Holy Ghost will seal a Christian until the return of Jesus for
his bride. This means that a true Christian cannot lose their salvation.
Once saved, always saved. In ancient times when a deal for a purchase was
made it was sealed and could only be opened by the purchaser when he
received or took possession of what he bought. The Holy Ghost represents
this seal that only can be broken by Jesus when he returns for his bride
which he purchased with his shed blood on the cross at Calvary. (Acts
20:28 ¶ Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over
the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of
God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.) Only Jesus is able to
open the seven sealed scroll in heaven that John saw. (Revelation 5:9 And
they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to
open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God
by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;)
The Holy Ghost acts as the earnest money or down payment for Jesus to
guarantee that he will come back to get his bride and that the payment was
in full at the cross. (Ephesians 1:13-14 In whom ye also trusted, after
that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom
also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of
promise,
14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the
purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.) (Ephesians 4:30 And
grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
redemption.)   

The Holy Ghost sends people to be his witnesses to preach and tell
other people about Jesus. (Isaiah 48:16 ¶ Come ye near unto me, hear ye
this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that
it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.)
Philip was sent to talk to the eunuch by the Holy Ghost. (Acts 8:29 Then
the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.)
The Holy Ghost also physically moved Philip to another location like a
transporter again showing he is omnipotent and God. (Acts 8:39 And when
they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away
Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way
rejoicing.) The Holy Ghost will also forbad us from going to a people to
preach to them as he may have other plans for us and has someone else he
will send to the people we want to go to. Paul was not allowed to go to
Asia, but was sent by the Holy Ghost to Macedonia instead. (Acts 16:6 Now
when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were
forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,)

The Holy Ghost gives all believers at least one gift and some get
more than one depending on their walk with God and the grace given to us.
There are different gifts, but they are all given by the Holy Ghost. (I
Corinthians 12:4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.)
All of the gifts are important and a Christian should not be jealous of a
different gift that another Christian has or if someone has more than they
do. Christians should not think they are better than someone else because
of the gift they have versus someone else. For the Christian who does not
know their gift or gifts, then pray and ask the Holy Ghost since he is the
one who gave them to you so he knows what yours is. Some verses that list
the many gifts can be found in (I Corinthians 12:8-10 For to one is given
by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the
same Spirit;
9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by
the same Spirit;
10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the
interpretation of tongues:,) (I Corinthians 12:28-30 And God hath set some
in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers,
after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments,
diversities of tongues.
29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers
of miracles?
30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all
interpret?), (Romans 12:6-13
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us,
whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on
teaching;
8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with
simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with
cheerfulness.
9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to
that which is good.
10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour
preferring one another;
11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in
prayer;
13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.), and
(Ephesians 4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;). The Holy Ghost is the one
who allows missionaries to learn a foreign language.

These many verses and many others not mentioned clearly show that the
Holy Ghost is God and a person, not a force. The Holy Ghost can and should
be worshipped, though he tries to always point worship to Jesus. Let us
obey the Holy Ghost by witnessing to people about Jesus and if you are
unsaved, call upon Jesus when you are convicted of your sins by the Holy
Ghost so as to not grieve him and bring everlasting life for yourself. Let
us not forget or neglect the third member of the Godhead, God the Holy
Ghost.
