Thankful people in scripture  

We just celebrated Thanksgiving on Thursday and today we are going to
look at some people in scripture who were thankful for what God had done
for them. We set aside one day each year to give thanks to God for what he
does for us each and every day, yet we need to learn to be thankful every
day. We need to thank God every day for all aspects of our lives even the
things that are not good in our eyes. God has a purpose and plan for even
the bad things in our lives. We need to learn to trust in God in
everything and not just the good things and learn to thank God every day
including the fact that he gave us another day to live. We live in a
violent sin sick world and people are dying every day so we need to
rejoice when God lets us breathe for another day.

The first person from scripture that we will look at is an unnamed
individual. We will know his name when we get to heaven. We see from this
example that God knows who they are, but we need to just learn from their
thankfulness. Even the unnamed are important to God. This unnamed man was
one of the ten lepers that were healed by God. Ten lepers had cried out to
Jesus asking him to heal them. They all left as Jesus said to go to the
priest and they were cleansed when they left, but only this man returned
after seeing he was healed to thank Jesus for healing him. This man was a
Samaritan which were enemies of the Jews yet he gave thanks to God whereas
the other nine which were most likely Jews did not. Some people are never
grateful. Jesus even said to the leper where are the other nine. Jesus
said only this stranger returned to give thanks. Because this leper was
truly thankful Jesus not only cleansed his leprosy, but he also cleansed
and saved his soul so that one day we will see him in heaven. Leprosy was
a dreaded disease to get as you had to avoid all people and yet the other
nine remained in their sins as ungrateful men. (Luke 17:11-19 11 ¶ And it
came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of
Samaria and Galilee.
12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that
were lepers, which stood afar off:
13 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on
us.
14 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the
priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.

15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with
a loud voice glorified God,
16 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a
Samaritan.
17 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are
the nine?
18
There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.
19 And he said unto
him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.)

The next person we will look at is Elisabeth who was the mother of
John the Baptist. John the Baptist would go on to prepare the way for
Jesus and his ministry. Elisabeth and her husband Zacharias who was a
priest were unable to have a child as Elisabeth was well past child
bearing age. In those days it was a disgrace for a woman to not be able to
have a child and women especially wanted a child hoping they would give
birth to the Messiah. Godly women would pray for a child especially a son
unlike many women of today who quickly try to find a way to kill their
child by abortion. Zacharias had seen an angel who said Elisabeth would
have a son who would prepare the way for Jesus. Elisabeth was thankful
when God blessed her with a son. (Luke 1:7 And they had no child, because
that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.)
(Luke 1:24-25 24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and
hid herself five months, saying,
25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me,
to take away my reproach among men.)

Elisabeth's cousin Mary was also thankful to God when she found out
she was going to give birth to the Messiah Jesus who would come to earth
as the God-man to save mankind. Mary had been given the special privilege
to give birth to the Messiah. All Jewish women had always wished they
would be the one, but it was the young girl Mary who was chosen. Mary did
not know how it would happen, but she trusted the Lord to make it happen
just as she was told her cousin Elisabeth had become pregnant in her old
age. (Luke 1:46-49 46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,
47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold,
from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his
name.)

The unknown author of Psalm 111 starts off the psalm by praising God
and praising God with his whole heart. This shows this man was sincere and
thankful for all that God had done for him in his life and what he knew
God would continue to do in his life. (Psalm 111:1-10 1 Praise ye the
LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the
upright, and in the congregation.
2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have
pleasure therein.
3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for
ever.
4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious
and full of compassion.
5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of
his covenant.
6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them
the heritage of the heathen.
7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are
sure.
8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
uprightness.
9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for
ever: holy and reverend is his name.
10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding
have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.)

Following the crossing of the Red sea by the Israelites, God closed
the sea upon the Egyptian army killing all of them including pharaoh.
Miriam the sister of Moses was thankful for what God had done and so she
began to dance and sing to God to give him praise and thanks. Her show of
thankfulness to God rubbed off onto the women around her who joined her in
giving thanks and praise to God. Oftentimes when people see us thanking
God then it will encourage others to do the same. We need to influence
people in godly ways rather than sinful ways. (Exodus 15:20-21 20 ¶ And
Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand;
and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed
gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.)

Hannah was another woman who was left barren by the LORD. She
desperately wanted to have a son hoping just like Elisabeth did and all
the Jewish girls to be the one to give birth to the Messiah. Hannah had
gone before the LORD in prayer at the temple praying and asking for a son.
This is the first thing we need to do is pray. That shows that we trust
God to be in control and are thankful that we can pray to him. Hannah
promised to give her son to God to serve him all his life if God would
give him a son. Hannah was obedient in doing this and so God blessed
Hannah with three more sons and two daughters. The child she loaned to God
was Samuel who was the great prophet and first judge of Israel. When
Hannah brought Samuel to the temple to live there and serve God she gave
thanks to God for giving her a son that she could loan to God. (I Samuel
2:1-2 1 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine
horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;
because I rejoice in thy salvation.
2 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither
is there any rock like our God.) The prayer continues to verse 11.

David in the fifty one verses of the entire chapter of II Samuel 22
gives thanks to God and praise for his victory over Saul and the
Philistines and other of his enemies who had tried to prevent his ruling
as king. Saul's own family as well as others had attacked David and he had
just defeated Philistine giants and so David was very thankful to God. He
put the thanks in the right place as it belongs to God. (II Samuel
22:48-51 48 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
under me, 
49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me
up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from
the violent man.
50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and
I will sing praises unto thy name.
51 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his
anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.)

Paul and Silas had been preaching in Philippi when they cast a devil
out of a woman that had brought much money to the people. This angered the
people so they beat Paul and Silas with stripes using whips that cut into
the skin and put them into prison with their feet in stocks that locked
the feet into place. They would not even have been able to move their
feet. They were most likely in a cold damp cell yet these two godly men
still thanked God for the situation they were in that they could have this
happen to them for serving God. At midnight they sang praises to glorify
and thank God. Most people would have been bitter and angry and not
thinking about thanking and praising God for their current situation, but
not Paul and Silas. Because these two men thanked God instead of being
ungrateful, the Lord used these two men to lead the Philippian jailor to
salvation along with his whole house. God gave them freedom for honoring
him. (Acts 16:25-26 25 ¶ And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang
praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.
26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of
the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and
every one's bands were loosed.) (Acts 16:34 And when he had brought them
into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God
with all his house.)

Paul gave thanks to God for the Philippians who partnered with him in
helping to spread the gospel. (Philippians 1:3-5 3 I thank my God upon
every remembrance of you,
4 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
5 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;)

Jesus himself gave thanks to God on many occasions. He himself is God
yet as a man he set the example as always for us to be thankful to God in
everything and for everything. Here are just a few times that Jesus gave
thanks to God. Jesus often gave thanks for food just as we should. Jesus
gave thanks for the food before he fed the five thousand. This
thankfulness allowed a small lad's lunch of five barley loaves and two
fishes to feed five thousand. (John 6:11 And Jesus took the loaves; and
when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the
disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much
as they would.) When Jesus instituted the Lord's supper he gave thanks
both for the cup and the bread prior to distributing them. (Luke 22:17-19
17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and
said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:
18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until
the kingdom of God shall come.

19 ¶ And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them,
saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.)
Jesus thanked God the Father for hearing him when he prayed to bring
Lazarus back from the dead. He thanked God for hearing him and said he
knew he would hear him. God will always hear the prayer of those who are
walking with him and Jesus always walked with God. (John 11:41-42 41 Then
they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus
lifted up his eyes, and
said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which
stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.)

This was just a few examples of godly individuals who gave God thanks
for the situations they were in or for what God had done for them. We too
need to learn to be thankful to God in all situations and for all that he
does for us and not take God for granted the way the heathen do. Here are
a couple of verses about giving thanks. (I Thessalonians 5:18 In every
thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
you.) (Hebrews 13:15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise
to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
name.) (Colossians 3:17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in
the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.)
For those of us who are saved we need to thank God for sending his Son to
die on a cross for us and rising again on that third day so that we might
have everlasting life. Jesus bore our sins on the cross so that we would
not have to. Let us learn to be thankful all the time unlike the unsaved
who are rarely thankful. For those who are not saved, call upon Jesus
today and thank God for saving you. Thank God that he has allowed a way
for us as wretched sinners to not spend eternity in the lake of fire.
Remember to thank God every day and not just on Thanksgiving.
