Why we must be born again

When God (Jesus) created man (Adam was the first man) from the dust
of the earth and breathed life into him on day 6 of creation (a little
less than 6,000 years ago), man was perfect and not in need of salvation.
God provided Adam with a wife (Eve) made from one of his ribs. They walked
with God and talked with him. This was how it was meant to be until sin
entered into the world. They lived in the garden of Eden and were told
they could eat of every tree in the garden except for the tree of
knowledge of good and evil or they would surely die. (Genesis 2:17 But of
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for
in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.) Satan tempted
Eve (as a serpent) to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil by
convincing her she would not die and that God did not want her to eat of
the tree so as they would not be as gods. (Genesis 3:5 For God doth know
that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye
shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.) Eve saw the tree was pleasing to
the eye and thus ate of it. Today people are still trying to be gods. We
see this today especially in cults such as the Mormons and David Koresh
and his followers, et cetera. Eve then gave the fruit to her husband Adam.
Adam knew better as God had told him about the tree and he then told Eve.
Adam was not deceived, Eve was. (I Timothy 2:14 And Adam was not deceived,
but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.) When Adam ate of
the fruit, sin entered into the world. Unlike what old earth Christians
teach, there was no death before Adam including dinosaurs. Death came
about because of Adam's sin. (I Corinthians 15:22 For as in Adam all die,
even so in Christ shall all be made alive.) Just as God had said they
would die the day they ate of the tree, they did. From that moment they
were spiritually separated (dead) from God. They immediately knew they
were naked and were ashamed and tried to cover themselves and hide from
God when he called out to them. The link to talk directly to God and walk
with him was broken thus man had to be born again to restore that link
with God. (I Corinthians 15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam
was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.) The
last Adam is Jesus who gives us eternal life and restores the link with
God the Father. Adam also died that day in the sense that in God's eyes a
day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as a day. (Psalm 90:4 For
a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as
a watch in the night.) (II Peter 3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this
one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
thousand years as one day.) Adam only lived to be 930 years old and
Methuselah, the oldest person to ever live died at 969 years old thus man
always died in one day in God's eyes. From the moment of man's sin, all
people born after Adam and Eve are born with a sin nature (you do not have
to teach a baby to lie or steal) and thus need a Saviour in Jesus Christ
to wash away their sins. God is omniscient (all knowing) and thus knew man
would sin before he ever created the world. God in his mercy had a plan to
restore the relationship with man lost due to sin before the foundation of
the earth and before time began. God created time. Time is for man, not
God. (I Peter 1:18-21 18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed
with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation
received by tradition from your fathers;
19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and
without spot:
20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was
manifest in these last times for you,
21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and
gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.) (II timothy
1:8-10 8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor
of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel
according to the power of God;
9 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to
our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us
in Christ Jesus before the world began,
10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light
through the gospel:)

Revelation 13:8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose
names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world.
9 If any man have an ear, let him hear. ( Jesus was slain for us before
man was even created. God knew in his omniscience that man would sin and
he would need a way to restore the relationship with God and man. God
loves us so much that he had already made a plan to sacrifice his Son
Jesus for us before the foundation of the world.)

Man must call upon Jesus to save them (man cannot save himself) and
restore the broken link from God due to sin in order to go to heaven and
avoid the eternal stay in the lake of fire. See What must I do to be saved
(be born again) have eternal life and go to heaven? Genesis 3:15 And I
will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her
seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. (shows us
God's plan through his son Jesus to defeat Satan which he did with his
death on the cross and when he rose victoriously on the third day and then
proclaimed his victory and Satan's defeat when Jesus preached to the
spirits locked in hell. (These are the evil angels that sinned by
procreating with women and producing giants. See Genesis 6:1-4 (And it
came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and
daughters were born unto them,
2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and
they took them wives of all which they chose.
3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that
he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when
the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children
to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.), I
Peter 3:19-20 (By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in
prison;
20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God
waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few,
that is, eight souls were saved by water.), II Peter 2:4 (For if God
spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and
delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;),
Jude 6 (And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their
own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto
the judgment of the great day.), and other verses on this subject.))

God made all mankind (male and female) with a spirit, soul, and body.
When Adam sinned, the link to communicate directly with God was broken.
This was done with our spirit. We worship God with our spirit.
(Philippians 3:3 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the
spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.)
(John 4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth.) When a person is born again, their spirit is
reactivated and the link is reconnected with God. (I Thessalonians 5:23
And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole
spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ.) The word of God can reconnect that link if acted upon.
(Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts
and intents of the heart.) The body is dead without the spirit. Ye must be
born again. (James 2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so
faith without works is dead also.) (I Corinthians 15:45 And so it is
written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made
a quickening spirit.) Jesus is the last Adam who will quicken (make alive)
our spirit when we receive him as our Saviour.

All of creation groaneth and waits for the new heavens and new earth
under Jesus. Creation groans because of Adam's sin. Let us help creation
out by one getting saved and having fewer sin in the universe for creation
to groan about.(Romans 8:22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth
and travaileth in pain together until now.) The verses on the new heavens
and new earth are found in (Isaiah 65:17 ¶ For, behold, I create new
heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come
into mind.), (Isaiah 66:22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which
I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed
and your name remain.), and (II Peter 3:13 Nevertheless we, according to
his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteousness.). Revelation chapter 21 also describes the new heaven and
new earth.)
