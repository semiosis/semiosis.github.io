Proof that Jesus is God

I am sure everyone here today believes Jesus is God, but I want to
remind everyone he is and show verses that will allow people to witness to
those who deny the deity of Jesus.

Many cults deny the deity of God or minimize his position and
authority. The Jehovah's Witnesses believe Jesus was created and was
originally the archangel Michael of the Old Testament prior to coming to
earth as a man and becoming Jesus. They deny the deity of Jesus. The
Mormons also believe Jesus was created and that he was the spirit brother
of Lucifer with Jesus being the first born and then Lucifer with all other
angels and people following. When God asked for one to become the Saviour
of man, both Jesus and Lucifer offered to be the Saviour of mankind. God
chose Jesus and this caused Lucifer to rebel and become Satan. Mormons
believe Jesus was created first and then created everything else. Mormons
believe Jesus is a god, but not the living God. They also believe people
can become equal gods with Jesus. The Roman Catholics try to make Mary a
co-redeemer with Jesus. Mary is elevated above Jesus in the Roman Catholic
Church and say she also was born without sin and helps intercede for
people. That is what Jesus does, not Mary. The Muslims say Jesus was a
prophet and the only one that performed miracles, including their
supposedly greatest prophet Mohammed who did no miracles, but they deny
Jesus is God. There are other cults and false religions that deny Jesus is
God.

Jesus had the attributes, authority, titles and names of God and was
worshipped as God. He himself proclaimed to be God. Jesus had all of these
things because he is God. The gospel of John is written to show Jesus is
God.

Jesus is eternal and has no beginning or ending. (John 1:1-2 In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
2 The same was in the beginning with God.) We know from John 1:14 that the
Word is Jesus when he became a man in the flesh. (John 1:14 And the Word
was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as
of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.) Scripture
is the word of God. (Revelation 1:8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to
come, the Almighty.) Jesus is from everlasting. (Micah 5:2 But thou,
Beth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah,
yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel;
whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.) This same
statement is said of God. (Psalm 93:2 Thy throne is established of old:
thou art from everlasting.) and (Isaiah 63:16 Doubtless thou art our
father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not:
thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.)
Only God can have always been.

Jesus is omnipotent (all powerful). Jesus as the Word spoke the
universe into existence as our Creator. Only God can create something from
nothing. (Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the
earth.) (John 1:3-4 All things were made by him; and without him was not
any thing made that was made.
4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.) (Colossians 1:16-17
For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in
earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.) Jesus
holds the universe together. Jesus has control over the weather. He calmed
the sea and wind. (Mark 4:39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said
unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great
calm.)

Jesus is omnipresent (everywhere at the same time). (Matthew 18:20
For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
midst of them.) (John 3:13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he
that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.) John
3:13 shows Jesus in heaven at the same time he was speaking here on earth.
Most modern bibles remove the last part showing he was in heaven at the
same time denying his omnipresence. Only God can be everywhere. Even Satan
as a created being can only be in one place at the same time.

Jesus is omniscient (all knowing). Nothing takes Jesus by surprise.
He knows the future before it happens. He knows our thoughts. Only God can
be all knowing. Jesus knew Nathaniel was under a fig tree when Philip
found him to tell him Jesus was the prophet spoken of by Moses. (John 1:48
Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said
unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig
tree, I saw thee.) This also shows the omnipresence of Jesus. Jesus knew
Judas Iscariot would betray him. (John 13:21 When Jesus had thus said, he
was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, that one of you shall betray me.) (John 13:26 Jesus answered, He
it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had
dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.) Jesus
knew the Samaritan woman at the well had had five husbands and was living
with another man she was not married to. (John 4:18 For thou hast had five
husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst
thou truly.) Jesus could read thoughts. Only God can do that. Not even
Satan can read one's thoughts. (Luke 5:21-23 And the scribes and the
Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies?
Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them,
What reason ye in your hearts?
23 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise
up and walk?) Jesus knew the first fish Peter caught would have money in
it to pay tribute for them in Capernaum. (Matthew 17:27 Notwithstanding,
lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take
up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth,
thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and
thee.)

Jesus had many preincarnate appearances prior to becoming a man on
earth. This shows Jesus is no mere man. We mentioned many of these last
week such as the burning bush who spoke to Moses (Exodus 3:2, angel of the
LORD) or appearing to Abram (Abraham) as Melchizedek (Genesis 14:18) or
again to Abraham as a man (the LORD) with two holy angels before
destroying Sodom. (Genesis 18:22)

Jesus performed miracles that only God can do. Other people also did
miracles such as raising the dead as Jesus did, but theirs was done under
the power of God. Jesus as God performed the miracle of changing water
into wine, which is something only he can do as the Creator in changing
the elements. (John 4:46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where
he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was
sick at Capernaum.) Another example is the feeding of the 5,000 and the
4,000 by creating more bread and fish than was originally there. Jesus
healed a blind man who had been blind from birth which no man had ever
done.

Jesus was sinless. No man is sinless as all are born with a sin
nature thanks to Adam. Jesus being born of a virgin did not inherit that
sin nature and had to be sinless to take our place on the cross for our
salvation. Jesus had to be God to have no sin. (Hebrews 4:15 For we have
not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
sin.) (II Corinthians 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew
no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.)

God was manifest (revealed to us, made obvious, made known to us) in
the flesh. (I Timothy 3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of
godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up
into glory.) Jesus came in the flesh.

Jesus is part of the Godhead (Trinity) and included himself in it.
(Colossians 2:9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead
bodily.) (I John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the
Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.) (Matthew
28:19 ¶ Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:)

Thomas recognized Jesus as God. (John 20:28 And Thomas answered and
said unto him, My Lord and my God.) Jesus never rebuked Thomas for calling
him God.

Jesus is the Rock of the Old Testament. (I Corinthians 10:4 And did
all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock
that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.)

Jesus is called The mighty God in Isaiah 9:6. (Isaiah 9:6 For unto us
a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon
his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The
mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.)

God the Father shares his glory with Jesus. He will not share his
glory with man or angel or anything else, but only Jesus since he is God.
(Isaiah 42:8 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give
to another, neither my praise to graven images.) (Isaiah 48:11 For mine
own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be
polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.)  (John 17:5 And now,
O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had
with thee before the world was.)  

Jesus said "I and my Father are one". (John 10:30 I and my Father are
one.) The Jews response in John 10:33 was to stone Jesus for blasphemy.
(John 10:33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee
not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself
God.)

Jesus said he was the Son of God. The Jews recognized someone who was
the son of a dad as having the same characteristics of the dad and they
were the same. They recognized Jesus saying he was God and accused him of
blasphemy, but as God, Jesus can make this claim.

This was also seen in the seven "I am" statements made by Jesus in
John. By saying "I am" he was saying he was God. God told Moses his name
was I AM THAT I AM". (Exodus 3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM:
and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM  hath
sent me unto you.) Jesus also told them he existed before Abraham again
showing he always was. (John 8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.)

Jesus was worshipped, accepted the worship and never rebuked anyone
for worshipping him. Jehovah's Witnesses claim Jesus was not worshipped in
scripture. There are many, many verses showing he was. Man and holy angels
refused worship, saying it belongs to God.

Leper worshipped Jesus and was cleansed. (Matthew 8:2 And, behold,
there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou
canst make me clean.)

The apostles worshipped Jesus in the boat after Jesus and Peter
walked on water. (Matthew 14:33 Then they that were in the ship came and
worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.)

Ruler whose daughter was dead and raised by Jesus worshipped Jesus.
(Matthew 9:18 ¶ While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came
a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead:
but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.)

God the Father commands all the angels to worship Jesus at his birth
as a man. (Hebrews 1:6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten
into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.) [God
would not command the angels to worship Jesus if he were only a mere man,
but would if he were God as he is. Jesus was the God-man, 100% God and
also 100% man. God is a jealous God and shares his glory with no one.
(Exodus 34:14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose
name is Jealous, is a jealous God:)]

(Philippians 2:10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;)

There are many more examples of people and angels worshipping God.

Jesus forgave sins which only God can do. Even the scribes knew this.
(Mark 2:5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy,
Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.)

We are to look for "the glorious appearing of the great God and our
Saviour Jesus Christ". (Titus 2:13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the
glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;)

John 8:12 and John 9:5 says Jesus is the light of the world.(John
8:12 ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the
world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the
light of life.) and (John 9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light
of the world.) I John 1:5 says God is light. (I John 1:5 This then is the
message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is
light, and in him is no darkness at all.)

Jesus is King of kings and Lord of lords. (Revelation 17:14 These
shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is
Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called,
and chosen, and faithful.)

God the Father said unto the Son (Jesus) "Thy throne, O God, is for
ever and ever:". (Hebrews 1:8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O
God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of
thy kingdom.) (Psalm 45:6-8 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the
sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy
God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory
palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.) (Psalm 45:6 is quoted in
Hebrews 1:8) God the Father was calling Jesus God. No more proof needed.

As seen in the above verses and many more in scripture they clearly
show Jesus is God. No mere man could have the authority, attributes,
titles and names of God or do the works of God unless they were God. Jesus
fulfills all of those. Jesus is God.
