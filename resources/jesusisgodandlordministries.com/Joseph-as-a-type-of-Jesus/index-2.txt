Joseph as a type of Jesus

Joseph was a man of God and a type of Jesus. The story of Joseph is
found in Genesis 37, 39-50. Joseph represented Jesus in many ways. Joseph
was the eleventh of twelve sons born to Jacob and the first of two born to
his wife Rachel who was Jacob's favorite wife. Joseph just like Jesus was
born with the supernatural intervention of God. Rachel's womb was barren
since God saw that Jacob disliked Leah. (Genesis 29:31 ¶ And when the LORD
saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.) Leah
would go on to have six sons and one daughter. Rachel's maid Bilhah had
two sons and Leah's maid had two sons. Rachel blamed Jacob for her
barrenness, but Jacob understood it was God's doing. (Genesis 30:1-2 And
when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister;
and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's
stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?) When Jacob was
of old age and it seemed that Rachel would not give birth to any children,
then God intervened supernaturally and opened the womb of Rachel and
allowed the birth of Joseph. Without God opening the womb, Rachel would
have stayed barren. (Genesis 30:22-24 22 ¶ And God remembered Rachel, and
God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my
reproach:
24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me
another son.) Joseph was the favorite son of Jacob. (Genesis 37:3 Now
Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of
his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.) Just as Joseph was
born supernaturally through intervention of God, so was Jesus. Jesus was
born of a virgin who was impregnated by God the Holy Ghost. (Matthew 1:18
¶ Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary
was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
child of the Holy Ghost.) It is interesting that the future husband of
Mary was named Joseph.   

Joseph's ten older brothers hated Joseph because he was the obvious
favorite of Jacob. His brothers were jealous. (Genesis 37:4 And when his
brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they
hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.) Joseph had a dream
that he told his brothers and said that one day they would bow down to
him. This made them hate Joseph even more. (Genesis 37:5 ¶ And Joseph
dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the
more.) In the dream Joseph said his parents and his brothers would bow
before him. In the dream they are represented as the sun, moon, and eleven
stars. The sun represented Jacob, the moon his mom, and the eleven stars
his eleven brothers including his younger brother Benjamin. (Genesis 37:9
¶ And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said,
Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and
the eleven stars made obeisance to me.) Later when Joseph became the
second ruler over Egypt during the famine, his brothers came to Egypt to
get food and bowed before Joseph. (Genesis 42:6 And Joseph was the
governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the
land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him
with their faces to the earth.) Joseph was a ruler in Egypt and Jesus is
King of kings. (Genesis 41:40-41 Thou shalt be over my house, and
according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne
will I be greater than thou.
41And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of
Egypt.) (Revelation 17:14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb
shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they
that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.) Just as in
Joseph's dream the sun, moon, and stars bowed before Joseph, the real sun,
moon, and stars worship Jesus. (Psalm 148:3 Praise ye him, sun and moon:
praise him, all ye stars of light.) Just as Joseph's brothers originally
rejected Joseph until their time of need when they bowed before him,
Jesus' half-brothers also originally rejected Jesus, but ultimately
worshipped him after his resurrection. Two of Jesus' half-brothers wrote
books of the Holy Bible. James would call himself a servant of his
half-brother Jesus as did Jude. (James 1:1 James, a servant of God and of
the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad,
greeting.) (Jude 1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of
James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in
Jesus Christ, and called:) When Joseph's brothers first heard the dream
that they would bow before Joseph they envied him, but Jacob observed the
saying. (Genesis 37:11 And his brethren envied him; but his father
observed the saying.) When Joseph and Mary were looking for Jesus when he
was 12 after he stayed behind to speak with the Jewish leaders in the
temple, Mary asked Jesus why he had stayed behind. Jesus said he was about
his Father's business. Mary kept this saying in her heart. (Luke 2:49 And
he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be
about my Father's business?) (Luke 2:51 And he went down with them, and
came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these
sayings in her heart.)

Joseph was persecuted by his brothers especially after he told them
the dream. One day they saw him coming and hated him and decided to kill
him. (Genesis 37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came
near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.) God said that
hate was the same as murder. (I John 3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is
a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in
him.) They would throw him in a pit to die, but ultimately decided to sell
him into slavery. Just as Joseph's brothers tried to stop the calling by
God for Joseph and the fulfillment of his dream, the leaders of Israel
tried to prevent the calling of Jesus by God to die on the cross for our
sins and to also be the Jewish Messiah when they said to Jesus that if he
was God and King of Israel to come down from the cross. (Matthew 27:42 He
saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him
now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.) Jesus as God could
have done so, but then he would never have redeemed man and allowed for
salvation of mankind. Satan always tries to stop God's man and God's plan.
Joseph would be brought to Egypt were he would be the servant of Potiphar.
(Genesis 39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an
officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the
hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.) Just as
Joseph ended up in Egypt, so did Jesus when Joseph brought him and Mary
down to Egypt to escape from Herod who was planning to kill Jesus.
(Matthew 2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child
and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee
word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.) Just as
Joseph's brothers wanted him dead, Herod and later the Jewish leaders
wanted Jesus dead. Potiphar's wife wanted Joseph to lie with her, but he
refused, so she falsely accused Joseph of raping her and Joseph was
unjustly put in prison. Joseph stayed in prison until his elevation to
rule as second in command of Egypt before the coming famine. (Genesis
39:17-18 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock
me:
18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left
his garment with me, and fled out.) Just as Joseph was falsely accused, so
was Jesus when he was falsely accused of saying he is the Messiah and King
of Israel when he is. (Luke 23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We
found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to
Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.) (Mark 15:3 And the chief
priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.) (Matthew
26:59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false
witness against Jesus, to put him to death;) Jesus was persecuted just
like Joseph. Jesus was betrayed by a man pretending to be his friend.
(Mark 14:10 ¶ And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
priests, to betray him unto them.) He was scourged prior to his death on
the cross and crucified on the cross. (Matthew 27:26 ¶ Then released he
Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be
crucified.) Just as Joseph was arrested, so was Jesus prior to his death
on the cross. (Genesis 39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him
into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was
there in the prison.) (Mark 14:53 ¶ And they led Jesus away to the high
priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders
and the scribes.)  

Joseph was tempted by Potiphar's wife to lie with him, but Joseph
refused. (Genesis 39:7-10 7 ¶ And it came to pass after these things, that
his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master
wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that
he hath to my hand;
9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back
any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do
this great wickedness, and sin against God?
10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he
hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.) Jesus was
tempted by Satan for forty days in the wilderness. (Mark 1:13 And he was
there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the
wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.) (Hebrews 4:15 For we
have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
sin.) Neither Joseph nor Jesus sinned during their temptations.

Joseph forgave his brothers for selling him and their hatred towards
him. (Genesis 50:17-21 17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray
thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto
thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of
the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they
said, Behold, we be thy servants.
19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good,
to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
21Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And
he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.) Scripture also never says
Joseph sought revenge against Potiphar or his wife. Jesus forgave those
who crucified him. (Luke 23:34 ¶ Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them;
for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast
lots.) Jesus' death on the cross also forgives the sins of all those who
call upon him for salvation. (Ephesians 1:7 In whom we have redemption
through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his
grace;) Let these two men be examples in our lives to forgive.

Joseph was sold for twenty pieces of silver and Jesus was betrayed
for thirty pieces of silver. (Genesis 37:28 Then there passed by
Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit,
and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they
brought Joseph into Egypt.) (Matthew 26:15 ¶ Then one of the twelve,
called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
15And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto
you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.) Joseph was
betrayed by his own brothers and Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot who
had been one of his twelve apostles and a supposed friend.

When Joseph first saw his brothers he hid his identity from them.
(Genesis 42:7-8 7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made
himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto
them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.) Jesus also
concealed his identity to his disciples after his resurrection such as
Mary Magdalene thought he was the gardener and the two men on the road to
Damascus did not know who he was. (John 20:15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman,
why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the
gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where
thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.) (Luke 24:16 But their eyes
were holden that they should not know him.)

Joseph's coat of many colours that was dipped in the blood of the
goat was a type of Jesus' blood that was shed on the cross for our sins.
(Genesis 37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,
and dipped the coat in the blood;) This blood on the coat was to represent
Joseph's death to Jacob. Just as a goat had to die to have his blood to
cover the sins of the Israelites, the shed blood of Jesus on the cross
allows salvation and life to all of those who call upon Jesus to save
them. (Romans 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through
faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins
that are past, through the forbearance of God;)

Joseph's brothers meant to kill Joseph, but his being sold into Egypt
would lead to the saving of their lives when he as ruler of Egypt would
provide food and land for them during the famine. What they intended for
evil, God made good. (Genesis 50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil
against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this
day, to save much people alive.) Joseph would be the earthly savior for
many people as he provided for their needs during the famine. (Genesis
41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because
that the famine was so sore in all lands.) By preventing the deaths of his
brothers he kept the nation of Israel alive. (Genesis 45:7 And God sent me
before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your
lives by a great deliverance.) Jesus' death on the cross was meant for
evil by Satan, but it would ultimately bring salvation to all who call
upon Jesus whether Jew or Gentile. Jesus is the Saviour of the world.
(Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved.) (John 3:15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
have eternal life.) If Jesus did not die on the cross, he would not have
become our Saviour.

Joseph was 30 years old when he was made second in command to pharaoh
in Egypt. (Genesis 41:46 ¶ And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood
before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of
Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.) Joseph was told by
God that pharaoh's dream predicted seven years of plenty in Egypt followed
by seven years of famine. Joseph revealed himself to his brethren
[brothers] who were the patriarchs of Israel after two years of famine.
This makes Joseph 39 years old when he revealed himself to his brothers
who were Israelites [30 at time of dream followed by 7 years of plenty and
2 years of famine for 9 years total, so 39 years old]. God used 39 books
of the old testament to reveal his Son Jesus to the Israelites as well as
to all people. (Genesis 45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in
the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither
be earing nor harvest.) The number 39 means disease and it is the disease
of sin throughout the 39 books of the old testament that points to the
need for Jesus as your Saviour to cure us of our sin diseased soul. Jesus
is the only cure for the disease of sin. 

Jacob thought his favorite son Joseph was dead, but he later found
out he was alive. (Genesis 37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's
coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in
pieces.) (Genesis 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he
is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he
believed them not.) This represented the future resurrection of Jesus
after his death on the cross. Jesus died and was resurrected and rose
again from the grave on the third day so that we might have everlasting
life. (I Corinthians 15:3-4 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that
which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
scriptures;
4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according
to the scriptures:) Just as Jacob doubted that Joseph was alive, so did
the apostles at first doubt the resurrection of Jesus and many today still
do. (Luke 24:11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they
believed them not.) Jesus is indeed resurrected and sits at the right hand
of God the Father and is today our Saviour if you call upon him. (Hebrews
10:12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever,
sat down on the right hand of God;) Jesus is risen indeed. If there is one
listening today who doubts the resurrection of Jesus, today is the day to
end that doubting and call upon Jesus to save you. Let Jesus be your
Saviour.
