The Word Became Flesh

As we prepare to celebrate Christmas as the birth of Jesus then I
want to look at an often overlooked aspect of the Christmas story. We are
told in scripture that Jesus is the Word and that the Word became flesh.
(John 1:1-2 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.
2 The same was in the beginning with God.) (John 1:14 And the Word was
made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.) We will look
later at some more places that show Jesus as the Word. It is important to
understand the significance of Jesus as the Word becoming flesh and what
it really means. John 1:1-2 shows us that Jesus as the Word and the second
person of the Godhead has always existed and has been there since the
beginning. John 1:1 clearly shows the Word was with God the Father in the
beginning and is God. Jesus would have to be God to have been around since
God has. Jesus as God has no beginning. John 1:14 shows only the beginning
of Jesus as the God-man in the womb of Mary. John 1:14 is really what the
Christmas story is all about. Normally at Christmastime we always focus on
Jesus as a baby in a manger, but do not fully understand that that baby
was the Word who became flesh. You must understand that as I showed in
John 1:1 that the Word is God and so 1:14 is showing us that Jesus has to
be God as well and that when Jesus became flesh, then it was God in the
flesh. One of Jesus' names is Immanuel which means "God in the flesh".
(Matthew 1:23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth
a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is,
God with us.) It is important to understand that the Messiah and the
Saviour had to be God as only God could fulfill this role as a sinless
man. God as the Word became flesh or a man for us in order to bring
salvation to his creation. Jesus lowered himself even below angels.
(Hebrews 2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the
grace of God should taste death for every man.) Today cults, false
religions, and too many people see Jesus not as God, but as just a man.
Most as a good man, but a man none the less. Jesus as the Word is God and
it was that Word who became flesh. If the Word is God and the Word became
flesh then Jesus has to be God. When Jesus came on that first Christmas
then his only purpose was to bring salvation to man. We have seen this in
my study on the "I am statements of Jesus". (John 12:47 And if any man
hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge
the world, but to save the world.)  

Jesus is mentioned as the Word a total of seven times in scripture.
We have seen the first four times in John 1:1 and John 1:14. The next two
are found in I John. (I John 1:1-2 1 That which was from the beginning,
which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have
looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;
2 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and
shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was
manifested unto us;) Just as the gospel of John starts off by proclaim
Jesus is the Word and God, so does I John 1. In I John 1:1-2 we see Jesus
was there from the beginning. Again someone can only be at the beginning
if they were God. John then says that he and the other disciples had heard
and seen with their eyes and handled or touched the Word of life. This
confirms John 1:14 that Jesus as the Word became flesh. Jesus as flesh
could be touched and seen and be heard when he spoke. He was not spiritual
and invisible like angels. It is important that Jesus was seen and could
be heard, for this confirmed that he was flesh and he had to be flesh in
order to take our place on the cross and die for our sins, but he also had
to be the Word as God in order to bring that salvation. John confirms here
that Jesus was the God-man. He never gave up his deity when he became
flesh. Jesus could be heard and so as the Word people could hear God. As
the Word, Jesus gave his seven "I am" statements in John confirming he is
God. I John 1:2 goes along with John 1:14 showing that the Word became
flesh. This verse says that Jesus or the Word of life was manifested which
means made known to man. The Word became a man. The verse continues by
saying that Jesus gives eternal life. Verse 1 calls him the Word of life.
This shows that it is only Jesus who can give you life. As the Creator
Jesus gave birth to us all, but as the Saviour he gives everlasting
spiritual life to those who call upon him. No one can have life without
Jesus. He holds the universe together and that includes our bodies, but
more important than our physical bodies he gives us spiritual life as a
person can only be born again and reunited with God by his Son Jesus who
is the Word. (Colossians 1:17 And he is before all things, and by him all
things consist.)  

The next verse that shows Jesus as the Word is I John 5:7 which shows
Jesus as a part of the Godhead and clearly as the second person of that
Godhead. (I John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the
Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.) This verse
shows Jesus as the Word is one with the other two persons of the Godhead
showing there is one God.

The final time we see Jesus as the Word is found in Revelation 19:13
where he is called the Word of God. (Revelation 19:13 And he was clothed
with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.)
The very words that Jesus speak, show he is God. Jesus as the Word spoke
the universe into existence. (Hebrews 11:3 Through faith we understand
that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are
seen were not made of things which do appear.) His very word will also end
the Battle of Armageddon. The very words of God are compared to a sword.
We see in Revelation 19:13 that the clothes Jesus is wearing is a vesture
dipped in blood. That blood was the precious blood that Jesus shed for us
on the cross at Calvary in order to bring us everlasting salvation. This
blood was God's blood. This blood purchased the church as Acts 20:28 tells
us. It is only this blood that can bring us salvation.

Notice that all seven occurrences of Jesus and his name of the Word
are all found in books written by the apostle John. This is probably
because John saw more of Jesus in his full glory as God than anyone else
when Jesus revealed himself to John while giving him the book of
Revelation.

Jesus is the living Word. He is alive today and seated at the right
hand of God the Father. He arose from that grave on the third day. This
sets Jesus apart from all other religious founders as they are all dead. I
have already mentioned how the Word spoke the universe into existence.
When Jesus was in the garden praying just before his death then when the
men came to take Jesus as prisoner then Jesus asked them who they were
looking for knowing full well it was him. They told Jesus they were
looking for Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said "I am he". Upon hearing these
words from Jesus the men fell backward and to the ground. (John 18:6 As
soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell
to the ground.) This is how powerful the Word is as his very words show he
is God and put fear into men.

As I said, Jesus is the living Word. We are also told in scripture
that scripture is called the word of God or the word. Scripture is the
written word and Jesus is the living Word. It is important to understand
that these two are connected and go hand in hand, but they are distinct
just as the three persons of the Godhead are distinct one from another.
Today most modern corrupt counterfeit bibles capitalize word of God when
speaking of scripture. Most Christians do the same when writing and
speaking of scripture as the word of God thinking they are being reverent.
This corruption is wrong and needs to stop. Again, the written and living
word are connected, but they are not the same. The King James Bible with
its built-in dictionary and number patterns clearly show this as only the
living Word is capitalized while word in referring to scripture is lower
case. By capitalizing word for both, then you lose the distinction between
the living Word and the written word. The King James Bible is the written
word of God. While it is the living word of God and very much alive with
its number patterns, built-in dictionary, and many other things to prove
this, then it is still the written word. The King James Bible speaks to
our hearts if we let it, but it does not speak to us literally or verbally
the way the living Word did when Jesus walked on earth. Jesus became
flesh, while scripture is always written and never becomes a person.
Scripture is all about the living Word as we will see, but they still must
be kept separate. It was the living Word that became flesh that first
Christmas, not the written word which had not even been completed. Just as
Jesus grew into a man, the word of God also grew as God the Holy Ghost
revealed it to holy men of God until it was complete. Today scripture is
alive in that it will change the heart of man if they will let it do so.
We should treasure our King James Bibles, but never say our KJB is God
whereas with the living Word Jesus is God. The King James Bible is the
words of God, but not God. The words I speak are my words, but they are
not me. They reflect who I am, but they are still not me and it is the
same with the written word of God in the King James Bible and the living
Word of God in Jesus.

The living Word and the written word are very much connected and to
curse the King James Bible is basically the same as if a person cursed
Jesus to his face. Rejecting the King James Bible is rejecting the living
Word, but they are distinct one from another. Scripture as found in the
King James Bible speaks of Jesus throughout the Old Testament. Jesus was
partly revealed in the Old Testament, but is clearly revealed in the New
Testament. Jesus spoke about how the Jewish leaders did not recognize that
the Old Testament spoke of him. Jesus told the Jewish leaders and the
people to search the scriptures as they testified of him. (John 5:39 ¶
Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they
are they which testify of me.) (John 5:46-47 46 For had ye believed Moses,
ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.
47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?)
Moses showed Jesus as the Creator and as the Word which spoke all into
existence. Abraham told the rich man in hell that if his brothers did not
believe the written word as written by Moses and the prophets then they
would not believe if someone came back from the dead. (Luke 16:31 And he
said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they
be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.) The word of God is far more
powerful than a person coming back from the dead. If someone does not
believe the written word which speaks of the living Word, then there is
nothing that will convince them, even a miracle of the dead coming back to
life. After Jesus' resurrection, he met two men on the road to Emmaus and
told of himself throughout the entire Old Testament starting with the
books of Moses and continuing on through the prophets. (Luke 24:27 And
beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the
scriptures the things concerning himself.) This means he would have also
gone through the psalms and all books since all of scripture as the
written word points us to Jesus as the living Word.  

Jesus' words are referred to as a sword in Revelation. (Revelation
19:15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should
smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he
treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.) It is
this very sword or the very words of Jesus that will end the tribulation,
cast people into the lake of fire, and later speak a new heavens and earth
into existence. Just as a sword is deadly, so is the word of God as the
very words of the Word will bring all to their knees one day to tell him
he is Lord. This includes Satan. Scripture is also compared to a sword and
described as being even sharper than a twoedged sword. Scripture as the
written word of God will convict even the hardest of sinner if they will
let it and it will bring them to their knees and to salvation by Jesus the
living Word. The written word convicts us and shows us our need for a
Saviour, but it is the living Word that saves us. (Hebrews 4:12 For the
word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword,
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the
joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the
heart.) The written word of God is called the sword of the Spirit.
(Ephesians 6:17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the
Spirit, which is the word of God:)         

The written word is referred to as holy scriptures just as Jesus is
the holy child of God. (II Timothy 3:15 And that from a child thou hast
known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.) (Acts 4:30 By stretching forth
thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of
thy holy child Jesus.) Scripture is holy because it is the very written
words of God and Jesus is holy because he is the living Word.  

Scripture as the word of God is pure. The King James Bible is God's
pure words, not the modern corrupt counterfeits that try to imitate the
written word of God. (Psalm 12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as
silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.) (Proverbs 30:5
Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust
in him.) Jesus as the sinless Lamb of God and living Word is also pure
having never been defiled by sin.

Just as we all need Jesus the living Word for life, then we also need
the written word of God for life. Jesus said we are to live by every word
of God. (Luke 4:4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man
shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.) It is this
written word of God that will lead us to the living Word of God.  

We see the connection between the written and living word of God in
how the tribulation saints will be slain for the word of God. (Revelation
6:9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls
of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which
they held:) Here it speaks of the written word of God, but they were also
slain for their testimony of Jesus. The two go hand in hand. Another
example of this connection between the two can be seen in I John 2:14. (I
John 2:14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that
is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are
strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the
wicked one.) John speaks of the word of God abiding in believers. Jesus
the living Word of God abides in us, but so does the written word of God
if we read scripture. It is the written word that shows us we have
overcome the wicked one by receiving the living Word.

Scripture or the written word of God will never pass away just as the
living Word will always exist. (Matthew 24:35 Heaven and earth shall pass
away, but my words shall not pass away.) The written word cannot pass away
since it is the written words of God and since God cannot pass away then
neither can his words.

The living Word and the written word are inseparable, just as the
Godhead is inseparable, but they are distinct one from the other just as
the three persons of the Godhead are one from another, but are one. The
living and written word are also one in that the written word is alive as
we saw in Hebrews 4:12 in its ability to split soul and spirit asunder.
Only the living God could do that. Other scriptures show the connection
between the living Word and written word, but also how they are not the
same. The living Word is Jesus and the written word is the words of God or
scripture. Please show this distinction in your writing just as God does
in his written word, the King James Bible.   

As we celebrate Christmas and the birth of Jesus, let us look at the
baby in the manger as more than just a baby. That baby was none other than
the living Word that became flesh and dwelt among us. This baby was God in
the flesh who fulfilled the written word so that he might come and bring
salvation to man. Let us see the inseparability of the living Word and the
written word, but do not make them the same. Thank God that the Word
became flesh for if Jesus had not become the God-man on that first
Christmas then we would have never been given the salvation that the
written word promised us. Make this coming Christmas a day that we give
thanks to the living Word. If you are not saved, then please call upon
Jesus today and receive the living Word so that he may abide in you.
