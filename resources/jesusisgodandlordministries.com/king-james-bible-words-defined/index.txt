King James Bible Words Defined

MEANING OF KING JAMES BIBLE WORDS AND PHRASES (Words can have more than
one meaning depending on the context.)

a little season- a short time

Angel of the LORD-in the Old Testament refers to the pre-incarnate (prior
to coming to earth in the flesh as Jesus) Christ.

asswaged-abated, subsided, made less in intensity. This does not mean
recede like modern translations use.

asunder-apart

Beelzebub-Devil or Satan

beeves-plural of beef (cattle intended for meat).

begat-preterit (past perfect tense) of beget. A child procreated by the
father.

begotten-past participle of beget. A child procreated by the father, not
the mother.

beguiled-deceive

behold-look (at), see

betwixt-between

bewitched-cast a spell over

bewray-betray, show

blasphemeth-speaks of God in an irreverent, impious manner, curses

brethren-brothers (plural of brother)

brimstone-sulfur

bullock-a castrated male bull steer used for beef

bunches of camels-humps on camels

by and by-immediately

cattle-any domesticated animals used for labor including bulls, cows,
oxen, horses, camels, donkeys, sheep, and goats. In the United States we
call this livestock.

Cephas-Peter

charity-Christian love towards people, not just love that even unsaved
have towards people. Charity is Christians doing things for other
Christians in love since we are all brothers and sisters in Christ. These
are things that most likely would not be done if we were not Christians. 

chasteneth-discipline

chode-old preterit of chide. To scold, find fault, contend with words of
anger

clave-preterit of cleave. Clung

cock-rooster

consecrate-to set apart for God such as one's life to service for the LORD
such as preachers and missionaries.

corn-referred to any grain (wheat, barley, oats, rie, and not necessarily
maize or what we call corn. They still do in most parts of the old British
Empire.).

couch-bed such as in Genesis 49:4 and Luke 5:19 and Luke 5:24.

council-the Sanhedrin (Jewish leaders, like our Congress). Example is Acts
5:34

crew-preterit of crow. We now use crowed.

crisping Pins-a curling iron

dale-a valley. Dale is used in poetry.

dam-female of quadruped beasts

damsel-young, unmarried woman

devils-evil spirits, demons. I believe these are the giants (offspring of
fallen angels when they procreated with females here on earth) spirits
when they died in the flood of Noah's day. This is why they were always
trying to seek a body, whether a person or animal such as swine.

divers-different, various

dragon-when speaking of an animal it refers to dinosaurs [land reptiles],
plesiosaurs [sea reptiles], and pterosaurs [flying reptiles]. The word
dinosaur was invented in 1841 after the King James Bible was first
published in 1611. Two dinosaurs are mentioned: the behemoth which was a
sauropod (largest ever land animal or as God calls him "chief of the ways
of God") and leviathan which was a marine dinosaur (plesiosaur). Possibly
the pterosaurs (flying dinosaurs) are also mentioned. Dragon is also used
to refer to Satan (Devil).   

draught house-an outhouse

dumb person-refers to a mute person unable to speak

dung-manure

Easter-pagan festival. Not yet celebrated as the day of Jesus's
resurrection. It is not Passover as the corrupt modern translations use.
They are separate holidays and Easter came after Passover, but occurred
about the same time, just as they do sometimes still today.

edification- a building up in a moral sense

effeminate-males acting like or having the characteristics or appearance
of a female. This does not mean homosexual like many of the false modern
bibles say. One can act and dress like a female and still not be a
homosexual and homosexuals do not necessarily act or dress like a female,
though some do, but most do not. Most people who are effeminate are not
homosexuals.

espoused-betrothed, promised in marriage

eunuch-castrated male

even-usually used to refer to evening. Even is used in poetry. Evening in
prose (natural language of man) writing.

ewe-female sheep

fair-beautiful, pretty, attractive when referring to a person

fell asleep-died or just sleeping depending on the context

firmament-heaven

fishes-when more than one kind of fish is spoken of

fit-qualified or competent

fornication-lewdness, adultery, incest, any sinful sexual act outside
marriage, idolatry.

forthwith-immediately 

fowls- can refer to birds, bats, or flying insects (maybe also flying
reptiles such as pterosaurs as well) depending on context

gay-fine (as in fine clothes)

gendereth-begets (we now use engender)(such as cattle gender (breed) with
a diverse kind)

Gentile-non Jew

Grecia-Greece 

hallow-make holy, set apart

hart-male red deer

represents sin in the Holy Bible. To taint.

VERB ENDINGS (INFLECTIONS) EXPLAINED (From Dr. Gail Riplinger's work)

Most -eth verb endings are today changed to end in s. Examples are:
devoureth (devours), differeth (differs), lappeth (laps), etc.

After certain letters such as (ss, sh, th, x, ch, o, and i) change the
-eth to es. Examples are: passeth (passes), dresseth (dresses), doeth
(does), goeth (goes), etc.

Each ending of -th is changed to s. Examples are causeth (causes), ceaseth
(ceases), etc.

Drop every -est verb ending (together with any double consonant that
precedes it) to form modern equivalent. Examples are: huntest (hunts),
rebellest (rebel), runnest (runs).

Drop every -st verb ending to form the modern equivalent. Examples are:
troubledst-(trouble) and trustedst (trusted)

-EST is second person (the one spoken to) (first person is the speaker)

-ETH is third person (the one spoken about)

Examples: I write (first person)

Thou writest (second person)

He writest (third person)

-EST reminds you it is second person with its "s"

-ETH reminds you it is third person with its "t"

EXPLAINATION OF THEE, THOU, THY, THINE, AND YE (From Dr. Gail Riplinger's
work)

Thou, thee, thy, thine, and thyself are singular and always refer to only
one person. The "T" is a singular stick.

Ye, you, your, yours, and yourselves are plural and always refers to more
than one person. The "Y" is more than one stick.

Thou- used for the subject of the verb for the second person singular.
(Thou art the man)

Thee- used for the object of a verb for the second person singular. (I
gave thee bread)

Ye- used for the subject of a verb for the second person plural. (Praise
ye the LORD)

You- used for the object of a verb for the second person plural. (I give
you that)

Other Bible versions normally use "you" for all four cases.

The singular forms are (parenthesis show what other Bible versions use):

Nominative: thou (you)

Objective: thee (you)

Possessive adjective: thy (your)

Possessive pronoun: thine (yours)

The plural forms are:

Nominative: ye (you)

Objective: you (you)

Possessive adjective: your (your)

Possessive pronoun: yours (yours)



David W. Daniels has written a great little book that will fit into your
Holy Bible called The King James Bible Companion which defines over 600
words. It can be purchased at
https://www.chick.com/products/item?stk=1007&O=T for 49 cents. 

Two books that may be helpful are The Dictionary Inside The King James
Bible by Dr. Gail Riplinger and King James Bible's Built-in Dictionary by
Barry Goddard, both which can be purchased at www.avpublications.com. The
1828 Webster's dictionary can also be helpful.

Remember the King James Bible defines its own words unlike the modern
false bibles. God did this so you would not need a dictionary to read his
word.
