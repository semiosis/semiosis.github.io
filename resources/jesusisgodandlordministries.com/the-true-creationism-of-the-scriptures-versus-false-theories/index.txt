The True Creationism of the Scriptures versus False Theories

Many people including many pastors and theologians deny the true
creationism by God as mentioned in Genesis. Many deny the power of God or
minimize his involvement in creationism. Many eliminate God altogether and
push the false evolutionism created by Satan to deceive people. There are
two main theories believed in by professing Christians that we will look
at along with a few others briefly. Some deny that the time period
mentioned in Genesis is literal 24 hour days. All promote an old earth
which goes against the young earth as taught in scripture and proven by
true science. By allowing long ages for the earth and death prior to man,
this negates the gospel. If sin did not get passed along to man by Adam
and all mankind is born with a sin nature, then we have no need of a
Saviour and the death of Jesus on the cross was for nought. Note that not
everyone who believes in any of these false theories believes the exact
same thing.

The first is the Gap theory also known as the ruin-restoration
theory. This theory was first popularized by Thomas Chalmers in 1814. He
claimed it was first proposed by Simon Episcopius, an Arminian theologian
in the 17^th century. Arminian theology is wrong just as Calvinism is as
well. Thomas Chalmers was a Scottish minister. This is his words
describing it, "My own opinion, as published in 1814, is that it forms no
part of the first day but refers to a period of indefinite antiquity when
God created the worlds out of nothing. The commencement of the first day's
work I hold to be the moving of God's Spirit upon the face of the waters.
We can allow geology the amplest time ... without infringing even on the
literalities of the Mosaic record." ^ He clearly shows he believes in an
old earth and has no problem compromising scripture. The Gap theory really
took off for a while when it was pushed by Cyrus I. Scofield  in his
Scofield Reference Bible published in 1917. The Gap theory said that there
were two creations. The first was far in time past and then there was a
gap of a long indeterminate time between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2. Then
they say God recreated or restored the ruined earth and then created
everything in six literal 24 hour days. They say scripture says the earth
was without form and void and thus had to have been destroyed. This is
taken out of context as the original Hebrew as understood by the Jews was
this just means it was not finished. Not all who believe in the Gap theory
believe everything exactly alike. They say that when Lucifer and one third
of the angels that rebelled with him against God, then they were thrown
out of heaven to the earth and this is where Satan and his angels lived
and they controlled it. Some say he ruled with a throne here before his
fall. Views vary. Some even say there was a pre-Adamic race. This is
unscriptural and again promotes evolutionary belief that man was a cave
man and evolved into modern man.

The Gap theory believed by many allows for the long ages of science
and evolution. True science has shown that the earth is young. The
scientists of the Institute of Creation Research (ICR) have done great
work on this. The book The Genesis Flood by John C. Whitcomb and Henry
Morris is a great work on this showing how the flood was responsible for
the many things we see such as the Grand Canyon. It also explains the Ice
Age of which there was only one, not many as secular scientists believe.
Dr. Kent Hovind's great Creation Seminar Series also proves a young earth.
This theory also puts doubts into scripture about dinosaurs. They are
mentioned in scripture as dragons and one is behemoth, which was the
largest sauropod to ever live as well as the largest land animal to ever
live. False bibles try to deny dinosaurs were with man and say behemoth
was a hippopotamus. The description is clearly something much larger. (Job
40:15-24 15 ¶ Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass
as an ox.
16 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of
his belly.
17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped
together.
18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of
iron.
19 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword
to approach unto him.
20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the
field play.
21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
22 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook
compass him about.
23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he
can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
24 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.)

Some of the reasons people say the Gap theory is true is because it
says in Genesis 1:2 that the earth was without form and void. This was
explained early that God was not finished with his creation. This is just
like a potter who takes a lump of clay and makes something beautiful out
of it. It starts out without form. (Genesis 1:1-2 1 In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and
void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters.) The first act by God was to let there
be light. Another issue is they say Satan rebelled prior to creation and
him and the angels were created before the six days of creation. They are
wrong on both accounts. Scripture does not give a clear answer on what day
angels were created other than they were their watching God create at the
foundations of the earth. There is disagreement on exactly what moment
that it speaks of. Some say angels including Satan were created on day
four when the stars where made as angels are often associated with stars
in scripture. Whenever they were created, it was during the six days of
creation because we are told everything was made in six days. Angels are
everything. (Job 38:7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the
sons of God shouted for joy?) (Exodus 20:11 For in six days the LORD made
heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh
day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.) This
verse also shows the earth could not have existed for billions of years
before. Another complaint is that Satan and his angels rebelled prior to
the six days of creation. We have shown that they were all created at some
point on one of the six days. The reason Satan rebelled was because man
was made in the image of God and given authority over the earth. In his
pride he rebelled as he wanted to be God. We are told God said all was
very good at the end of his creation. If Lucifer was already Satan and had
rebelled, God would not say all was very good. (Genesis 1:31 And God saw
every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the
evening and the morning were the sixth day.)

The Gap theory has led to progressive creationism and to today's
theistic evolution. Progressive creationism says that God created new
forms of life gradually over a period of hundreds of millions of years.
They say this explains the fossil record. My God is powerful enough to
create everything at once just as it is told in scripture. This minimizes
Jesus who is the Creator.

Theistic evolution says God created everything by the Big Bang or
something and then all of the rest of creation was by evolution. Just as
in secular evolution which denies a God, theistic evolution promotes
billions of years and all of the false so called science that evolution
pushes such as death existed for millions of years long before man came
out and survival of the fittest. This is not what scripture teaches. As I
said death came about because of Adam's sin and it is not every man for
himself as pushed by the belief of evolution, secular or theistic
evolution. As I said, if death was here before Adam, we do not have a sin
nature and need of a Saviour and the death of Jesus on the cross was
pointless. We would still die in sin and go to hell and the lake of fire.
(Romans 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:)
This verse clearly shows there was no death before Adam.

Another newer break-off of these is called Intelligent Design. These
people acknowledge the ridiculousness and stupidity of evolution. They
admit that there are designs and patterns in creation and that there had
to be a designer, they just do not see the designer is God. They just push
it off, so it could be aliens or even Satan. This is dangerous thinking
and will still land you in hell.

Another belief among professing Christians is the day age theory.
This theory was pushed by the Scottish lawyer and geologist Charles Lyell
around 1833. This man was a friend of Charles Darwin and influenced him
and his evolution theory. This theory says the days in Genesis are not
literal 24 hour days but are thousands, millions or billions of years
depending on one's beliefs. Just as in the Gap theory, not all agree on
everything. The day age theory is an attempt by professing Christians to
believe in God and still believe in evolution just as is done in theistic
evolution or progressive creationism. Again as I mentioned above, my God
is able to create quickly and not takes billions of years to create. This
theory also promotes death before Adam denying the work done by Jesus for
our salvation. Christians need to stop trying to compromise with the world
and just believe what God said in the scriptures. Once you start
compromising on one part of scripture, it never ends. It will lead to
compromise in other areas of scripture. The Hebrew word for day used in
the Genesis creation story just as in the rest of scripture always means a
literal 24 hour period and has always been understood by the Jews in this
way. There are cases in scripture where day can be different from 24
hours, but it is clearly seen in the verses, such as the daytime of a day
is still called day. We do that ourselves even today, but people know what
we are referring to. This theory says each day matches an age given by
scientists such as the Cambrian Age, the Devonian Age (Age of Fish) or the
Mezosoic Age (Age of Reptiles when dinosaurs supposedly lived.) By saying
dinosaurs where not around with man again denies what scripture says. Some
bibles such as the RSV (Revised Standard Version) actually promote this
theory by changing in Genesis 1 from "the first day' or "the second day",
etc. to "one day" or "a second day". This denies they are literal 24 hour
days and again the superiority of the King James Bible as God's word.

Scripture clearly shows in Genesis that the earth is a little less
than 6,000 years old. One can easily count up the ages of the patriarchs
from Adam to Abraham seen in Genesis 5. We know when Abraham lived. There
is a disagreement by a couple of hundred years when he lived, but it still
is around 6,000 years. This is a big difference between 13.7 billion years
for the universe and 4.6 billion years for the earth as promoted by
evolution and some of these old earth creation theories. Scripture says
the earth was created for man, not Satan and his angels. (Isaiah 45:18 For
thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the
earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he
formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.) We also
know all of creation is to glorify God and was not before the earth. The
sun and other stars and the moon were all created after the earth. They
were made on day four as almost an after thought. (Genesis 1:16 And God
made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser
light to rule the night: he made the stars also.) We also clearly see God
made man and everything else. It did not evolve. (Genesis 5:1-2 1 This is
the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in
the likeness of God made he him;
2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name
Adam, in the day when they were created.) Scripture clearly teaches Jesus
is our Creator. (Ecclessiastes 12:1 Remember now thy Creator in the days
of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when
thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;) (Isaiah 40:28 ¶ Hast thou not
known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the
Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is
no searching of his understanding.) We see in Ephesians and Colossians
that Jesus created everything. (Ephesians 3:9 And to make all men see what
is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world
hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:) (Colossians
1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:)
For almost all of Christianity, believers and not believers believed in a
young created world by God. Only in the last few hundred years has inroads
been made to change this. True science has proven the young earth. We are
warned in scripture about false science so widely seen today. (I Timothy
6:20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:)

Scriptures clearly teaches God (Jesus) created everything about 6,000
years ago. The theories presented deny scripture that it is God's word
because they go against what is written. They lead to believing in
evolution, deny need for salvation, and ultimately no need for God. Most
of these theories agree with evolution in the order of things coming
about. They say the sun was here before the plants. Scripture says plants
were created on day three and the sun on day four. They say animals
evolved or changed into higher animals. God's word says animals reproduce
after their own kind. They do not become another animal. Young earth
creationism is a fact, not a theory. Christians just need to believe what
God said in his word. For true Christians that promote these theories, we
need to love them as a brother or sister in Christ, but rebuke them.
