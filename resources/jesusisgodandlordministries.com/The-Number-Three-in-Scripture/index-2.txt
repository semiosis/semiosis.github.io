The Number Three in Scripture  

The number three just like many numbers in scripture have meanings
that help us understand scripture. The number three is God's number along
with the number seven which I have preached on. The number three is
connected to the number seven and both mean completeness or divine
completeness. The number three is found commonly in scripture and just as
many numbers it has multiple meanings depending on the context. The number
three means resurrection, Godhead, and just like the number seven it also
can mean completeness. The number three is also found many times in
scripture indirectly besides the many times the actual word three is used.

We see the use of the number three present in the first verse in
scripture where the Godhead all take part in the creation. The Godhead
which is often referred to as the trinity consists of one God in three
persons; God the Father, God the Son the Lord Jesus Christ, and God the
Holy Ghost. The Hebrew word for God here is plural showing the Godhead.
The Godhead is also clearly seen in Genesis 1:26 when God created man and
it says "let us" showing the three persons of God. This same phrase is
used of the Godhead in Genesis 11:7 when the Godhead confused the
languages of the people at the Tower of Babel. John uses a three part
description for Jesus in Revelation 1:4. John shows that Jesus has always
existed as God, then as a man Jesus who died here on earth and is not here
physically now, and then he shows he will come again at the end of the
great tribulation. (Revelation 1:4 John to the seven churches which are in
Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and
which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;)
The word Godhead is only found three times in scripture. We see the
meaning of completeness for the number three in how the word fullness is
found in the fullness of God (Ephesians 3:19), the fullness of Christ
(Ephesians 4:13), and the fullness of the Godhead. (Colossians 2:9) The
word Holy Ghost is found 90 times in scripture with this being 3 x 30. 
Jesus was about 30 years old (3×10) when he began his ministry. 

God the Father speaks three times audibly to Jesus. The first time
was at his baptism in which the Godhead were all involved with the Holy
Ghost also appearing as a dove upon Jesus when he came out of the water.
God the Father said he was well pleased with his Son. May he be pleased
with all of us as well. (Matthew 3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying,
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.) The second time was at
the transfiguration of Jesus. At this transfiguration there were three
apostles with Jesus to witness this event showing the true glory of Jesus
as God. They were Peter, James, and John. These three inner circle
apostles were often given special privileges by Jesus. The transfiguration
was showing the deity of Jesus rather than his being a man. The
transfiguration is only found in three of the four gospels. (Matthew 17:5
While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a
voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased; hear ye him.) In this verse we see God the Father says to
hear his Son Jesus. Let this be a lesson to all of us to hear Jesus when
he speaks and then to obey what we hear. The third time God the Father
spoke audibly to Jesus was shortly before his death when he asked God the
Father to glorify him and he said he would. (John 12:28 Father, glorify
thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both
glorified it, and will glorify it again.)

Just as the Godhead is made of three persons, our bodies which are
made in the image of God are also in three parts with a soul, spirit, and
body. The body just houses the soul and spirit and those two will live
forever either in heaven for those who are saved and receive Jesus as
their Saviour and in hell for those who reject Jesus. (I Thessalonians
5:23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ.) The soul is the real you and is our conscience
which the Holy Ghost convicts when we sin. The spirit is what we worship
Jesus with. For the unsaved this is disconnected from God and it is
reconnected when we get saved. This is why the unsaved are just walking
dead even though they are physically alive.

Jesus prayed three times on the night before his crucifixion.
(Matthew 26:44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
time, saying the same words.) Jesus brought his inner circle of three when
he went to pray. (Matthew 26:37 And he took with him Peter and the two
sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.) Jesus told
Peter he would deny him three times before the night was over. (Matthew
26:34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before
the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.) Jesus asked Peter three times
if he loved him to match these three denials as well as did he love all
three members of the Godhead. (John 21:17 He saith unto him the third
time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he
said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord,
thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto
him, Feed my sheep.) Jesus was in the grave for three days and three
nights prior to his resurrection and Jonah as a type of Jesus and his
resurrection was three days and three nights in the whale's belly.
(Matthew 12:40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart
of the earth.) Jesus was crucified at the third hour. (Mark 15:25 And it
was the third hour, and they crucified him.) There was darkness upon the
whole earth for the final three hours that Jesus was on the cross. (Luke
23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all
the earth until the ninth hour.)

The Israelites traveled three days journey into the wilderness after
they left Egypt. (Exodus 8:27 We will go three days' journey into the
wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.)
God brought the plague of darkness upon Egypt for three days. (Exodus
10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a
thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:)

The two spies who went to Jericho spent three days hiding from their
pursuers. (Joshua 2:16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain,
lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until
the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.) It was three
days after the Israelites were deceived by the Hivites that they realized
they had been tricked. (Joshua 9:16 ¶ And it came to pass at the end of
three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that
they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.) Samson
stumped the people for three days with his riddle. (Judges 14:14 And he
said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong
came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the
riddle.) Saul searched for three days when he was looking for his asses.
(I Samuel 9:20 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set
not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of
Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?) Many other
times we see three days is how long something was in scripture. All
Israelite males were required to attend three feasts in passover,
Pentecost, and the feast of tabernacles. 

Three times in the old testament people were resurrected from the
dead showing one of the meanings of the number three. The first was the
son of the widow of Zarephath whom Elijah raised from the dead. Elijah
stretched himself upon him three times. (I Kings 17:21 And he stretched
himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O
LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.) The
second person brought back to life was the son of the Shumanite woman by
Elisha. (II Kings 4:34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his
mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his
hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child
waxed warm.) Notice in this verse that Elisha did three things after
laying upon the child. He put his mouth upon the child's mouth, his eyes
upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands. The third person resurrected
was a dead body that was placed in Elisha's grave. (II Kings 13:21 And it
came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band
of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the
man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood
up on his feet.) There were only three men resurrected to set the type of
Jesus being in the grave for three days. Three people are mentioned in the
gospels who were resurrected by Jesus. They were the son of the widow of
Nain (Luke 7:14-15), the daughter of Jairus (Luke 8:54-55), and Lazarus
(John 11:43-44). The phrase "resurrection from the dead" is found three
times, all in the new testament.

We see some cases of the number three in Revelation where the four
beasts say Holy, holy, holy over and over with one holy for each of the
three persons of the Godhead. (Revelation 4:8 And the four beasts had each
of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they
rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which
was, and is, and is to come.)  Just as the number seven gets stolen by
Satan who tries to copy God, this can also be seen with the number three
where Satan has his own unholy trinity of himself (dragon), the antichrist
(the beast) and the false prophet. There are three unclean spirits that
come out of the satanic trinity. (Revelation 16:13 And I saw three unclean
spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the
mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.) The final
three of the seven trumpet judgments are known as the three woe judgments.
(Revelation 8:13 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst
of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of
the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three
angels, which are yet to sound!) We also see the evil side of the number
three in that we fight against the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eyes, and the pride of life. (I John 2:16 For all that is in the world,
the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is
not of the Father, but is of the world.)     

The gospel is based on three things of Jesus in his death, burial,
and resurrection. (I Corinthians 15:3-4 3 For I delivered unto you first
of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins
according to the scriptures;
4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according
to the scriptures:) Noah had three sons and Job had three daughters. Job
had three friends and Abraham had three visitors in Jesus and the two
angels. God called out to Samuel three times when he called him to be his
servant. (I Samuel 3:8 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time.
And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.
And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.)

Just as the number seven is found throughout nature, so is the number
three. This is seen even in the first verse in scripture where we see God
creates a triune universe of time, space, and matter. (Genesis 1:1 In the
beginning God created the heaven and the earth.) Beginning is time, heaven
is space, and earth is matter and all were created at the same time as
they all must exist together as matter must have a space to exist in and a
time to exist in. Time is divided into past, present, and future. On day
three of creation the land appeared or rose from the water as representing
the resurrection of Jesus. There are three primary colors of red, blue,
and yellow. This is no coincidence as red is the shed blood of Jesus, blue
is separation for or from God, and yellow represents deity. Nature is
divided into three kingdoms of animal, plant, and mineral. Matter exists
in three forms of gas, liquid, and solid. There are three main forces of
nature in gravity, light, and electricity. The sun consists of chemical
reactions, heat, and light. Our brains are divided into three parts with
the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Atoms are made up of three things
in electrons, protons, and neutrons. Objects in nature are three
dimensional with a length, width, and a height. We can clearly see how the
number three not only in nature, but in scripture is very important to God
and its significance. The next time you read scripture look for the number
three and understand its meaning.
