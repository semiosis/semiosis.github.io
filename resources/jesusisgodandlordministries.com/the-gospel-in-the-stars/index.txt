The Gospel in the Stars

Today's sermon topic is controversial among many professing
Christians, but I believe I will show that what I am preaching on is
scriptural. God said the heavens declare his glory and righteousness.
(Psalm 19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
sheweth his handywork.) (Psalm 97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness,
and all the people see his glory.) I believe God originally placed the
gospel in the stars to be a witness to man prior to man having the written
word of God. God said he would always have a witness for his Son Jesus. I
believe God told Adam the meaning of the stars and the gospel and
commanded them to pass this along to their children and on to their
grandchildren and so forth so that all people would be without excuse.
Romans tells us that the creation itself reveals Jesus the Creator to all
people so that even if they have never heard the name of Jesus, they are
without excuse. (Romans 1:20 For the invisible things of him from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are
without excuse:) God created stars on day four and said he placed the
stars in the heavens (sky) to be a sign to us. The stars would predict his
coming Son Jesus and tell the whole world about Jesus. (Genesis 1:14 ¶ And
God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the
day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for
days, and years:) (Genesis 1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater
light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the
stars also.) God placed the stars in the exact location that he wanted so
that his gospel in the stars could be told ("signs"). They were not just
placed randomly. We know today that there are many places in space that
are empty of stars and others that are covered with stars so God clearly
placed them all with a purpose. (Psalm 8:3 When I consider thy heavens,
the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast
ordained;) God ordained his work so that it was exactly as he wanted it to
be. (Job 38:33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the
dominion thereof in the earth?) God made the heavens by his wisdom and in
his infinite wisdom he presented the gospel in the stars to mankind.
(Psalm 136:5 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy
endureth for ever.) God created the moon and the stars to rule over the
night with the sun ruling over the day. The sun is a type of Jesus and the
moon is a type of Christians and the stars represent the gospel that we
are to present to all people. (Psalm 136:9 The moon and stars to rule by
night: for his mercy endureth for ever.) When God placed the stars in the
heavens he placed them to form what scripture refers to as the Mazzaroth
and what we call in English the zodiac. (Job 38:32 Canst thou bring forth
Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?) The
zodiac consists of twelve constellations with each having three minor ones
known as decans (means a part) for a total of 48 constellations and is
along the celestial equator. The zodiac covers the entire width of the sky
and changes with new sets for the season in order to tell the whole story.
The word zodiac is said to mean animals and is where we get our word zoo
from, but it appears that the word zodiac actually comes from a word
meaning path or way as the zodiac gives the path or way to Jesus. God
originally used the zodiac to present the gospel, but today Satan has
turned it into astrology which God condemns. (Isaiah 47:13 Thou art
wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the
stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from
these things that shall come upon thee.) Satan always copies God and
twists what God has done to use it for his own purpose. No Christian
should have anything to do with the satanic astrology which only opens the
door to Satan. In the true God ordained gospel of the stars it starts with
Virgo the virgin and goes to Leo the Lion. In astrology, Satan changes the
order for his purpose in an attempt to destroy what God ordained to start
with Aries and end with Pisces. It has been said that there are twelve
main constellations which represent the twelve tribes of Israel from which
Jesus would come. Job tells us that God intentionally made constellations
such as the crooked serpent which represents Satan. (Job 26:13 By his
spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked
serpent.) The southern hemisphere has what is known as the Southern Cross
constellation (Crux) and I do not believe it is an accident that there is
a cross in the sky. God allowed Adam the privilege of naming the animals,
but he named the stars himself so that he could use them for his purpose
in presenting the gospel to the world. Just as he had all people from Adam
to Noah named a certain name to tell the gospel, the name of the stars did
as well. (Psalm 147:4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them
all by their names.) These names all told a story of his Son Jesus. In
biblical days, people's names told something about the person unlike today
when the child is randomly named. I believe it was these names and their
meanings and the stars associated with them that God told to Adam and then
to all mankind. Today the meanings are mostly lost as we have the written
scriptures found in the King James Bible so they are not as necessary and
Satan has gained control of the world and so influence it with his
astrology and star names have been changed mostly based on Latin names
which distort the original meanings which I believe was done
intentionally. The original Hebrew star names reveal the truth. This can
also be seen in other languages such as the Arabic star name. The stars
may have originally formed the appearance of the objects they are named
for, but just as today the constellations have no resemblance to their
supposed representative, they probably originally did not as well, but it
was rather their names that told the story and the shapes allowed us to
identify what star name went with each star. Some say the stars have moved
over time so the original shapes are lost. That is possible. Angels are
represented as stars in scripture and the Mazzaroth shows stars
representing both good and evil. The star of Bethlehem as told in Matthew
2 was another sign in the stars from God that showed that God had become
flesh so that we might have everlasting life. (John 1:14 And the Word was
made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.) You can see my
sermon Star of Bethlehem for more on that star.    

The gospel of the stars starts with Virgo which means virgin and
represents the seed of the woman which we know is Jesus from Mary. Virgo
represents Mary who was a virgin who gave birth to Jesus the man. Virgo is
often shown as a woman with an ear of wheat in one hand and a branch in
the other hand. Jesus is also referred to as the Branch. (Genesis 3:15 And
I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her
seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.) (Isaiah
7:14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin
shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.) (Isaiah
11:1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
Branch shall grow out of his roots:) Jesus compared himself to a corn of
wheat that must die in order to bring forth fruit that speaks of his death
on the cross followed by his resurrection as the firstfruits of
resurrection. This is seen in the ear of wheat in Virgo's hand. (John
12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the
ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much
fruit.) (I Corinthians 15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and
become the firstfruits of them that slept.) One of the stars in the
constellation Virgo is Zavijava which means "gloriously beautiful". Jesus
is described this way. (Isaiah 4:2 In that day shall the branch of the
LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be
excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.) The star
Vindemiatrix means "The Branch (or Son) who comes" and the star Subilon
means "ear of wheat". The constellation Bootes is one of the decans and
means shepherd showing Jesus as the chief Shepherd to all who were once
lost sheep (unsaved) and who needed salvation. (I Peter 2:25 For ye were
as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop
of your souls.) (I Peter 5:4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye
shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.)

Libra represents the suffering Redeemer in Jesus. Libra shows how all
must be redeemed (saved) by Jesus. (Isaiah 49:26 And I will feed them that
oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their
own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am
thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.) One of the decans
for Libra is the previously mentioned Crux (Southern Cross) showing how it
is because Jesus went to the cross and died for our sins that because he
rose from the grave we now may have everlasting life for those who call
upon Jesus for salvation. Another decan is the constellation Corona which
means crown and is found near the star Arcturus mentioned in Job. Jesus
was crowned with glory and honor and is King of kings. (Hebrews 2:9 But we
see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering
of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God
should taste death for every man.) (Revelation 19:16 And he hath on his
vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF
LORDS.)

Scorpio represents the conflict between Jesus and Satan. Conflict or
wounding was the original meaning of Scorpio. The crooked serpent
constellation I read about in Job is called today Serpens and represents
Satan in conflict with Jesus who wounds him on the cross. Its brightest
star is Unuk meaning "encompassing". Jesus was encompassed by dogs at the
cross (Psalm 22:16) and was compassed by the sorrows of death in Psalm
116:3. (Psalm 22:16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked
have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.) (Psalm 116:3 The
sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I
found trouble and sorrow.)

Sagittarius is the archer showing Jesus as the victorious Redeemer.
One of its decans is the constellation Draco meaning dragon representing
Satan as the dragon and showing his defeat with the resurrection of Jesus.
Draco originally meant to tread or trodden and is represented by Jesus
crushing his head as mentioned in Genesis 3:15 which we read and this is
Jesus rising from the grave. (Revelation 12:9 And the great dragon was
cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth
the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast
out with him.)

Capricornus is the goat with a fish tail. The goat was an animal used
by the Israelites for sacrifices which are no longer needed now that Jesus
made the final sacrifice for us on the cross at Calvary. The fish tail
represents the fact that Jesus now expects Christians to be fishers of men
to tell the world about their need for Jesus as their Saviour. (Matthew
4:19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
men.) Capricornus is often said to represent the start of the second act
of a three act story shown in the zodiac with each act having four main
constellations along with their decans. One of the decans is Aquila the
eagle that was pierced. Jesus was pierced so that we might have
everlasting life. (John 19:34 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced
his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.)

Aquarius is the water pourer and represents Jesus as the living
water. (John 7:38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out
of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.) One of the decans is
Piscis the southern fish which is Christians who have received the living
water of Jesus. Another decan is Pegasus the winged horse. This represents
the soon return of Jesus to earth who comes riding on a white horse at the
end of the great tribulation. (Revelation 19:14 And I saw heaven opened,
and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and
True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.)  

Pisces is represented by two fish bound together with a band. This
represents how Satan has a hold on all people as they are born with a sin
nature and only Jesus can set people free from the bondage of sin and
Satan. The sea represents the mass of mankind, but can often represent
evil as well that we must be freed from. One of the decans is Andromeda
the chained woman which represents the church which is the bride of Jesus
Christ. Satan tries to keep the church bound so that she will not spread
the gospel and he persecutes true Christians.

Aries is shown as a ram, but originally was always portrayed as a
lamb. Aries represents Jesus as the Lamb of God. (John 1:29 ¶ The next day
John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which
taketh away the sin of the world.) Aries particularly shows Jesus as the
sacrificial lamb for our sins. Lambs were often used by the Israelites for
sacrifices. Jesus was sacrificed on the cross as our passover lamb. (I
Corinthians 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new
lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for
us:) Astronomical records show that at the time of the Israelites exodus
from Egypt, the sun entered Aries on 14 Nisan which is the day that the
passover lamb is sacrificed. The stars move about and by the time Jesus
was crucified on that same day, then the sun was now located in the head
of Aries near the stars of Elnath meaning "the wounded" and Sheretan
meaning "the bruised" which both describe what happened to Jesus at his
crucifixion. Both of these stars are just outside Aries and are in the
constellation of Taurus. This is a good example of signs in the stars as
they moved to be in the right location for each event. God is in full
control of his creation.

Taurus is the first of the final four constellations for the final
act of the Messianic story of Jesus and the gospel in the stars. Act One
showed Jesus as the suffering Saviour, Act Two as the Redeemer, and Act
Three as the Judge and reigning Redeemer and King. Taurus was originally
looked at as a unicorn which scripture says was untamable. (Job 39:10
Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow
the valleys after thee?) It is believed this was actually a very large
extinct rhinoceros. The name unicorn can still be seen today in the
scientific name Rhinoceros unicornis  of the Indian rhinoceros. Taurus
represents Jesus as the coming Judge. Orion is one of the decans and its
second brightest star is Betelgeuse which is also the tenth brightest in
the sky. Its name means "the coming of the Branch" speaking of Jesus. It
is a very large red star representing the shed blood of Jesus for our
sins. Rigel is Orion's brightest star and means "the foot that crushes"
showing Jesus as the one stepping on Satan's head. Many other stars in
Orion speak of Jesus such as in the belt is the star Alnitak which means
"the wounded one". Scripture mentions Orion three times. (Job 9:9 Which
maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.) This
verse also mentions Arcturus a star in Bootes that is a decan of Virgo.

Gemini consists of two main stars in Castor and Pollux. These are the
Latin names. Paul rode on a ship with these names. (Acts 28:11 And after
three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in
the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.) Castor means Ruler or Judge
and Pollux means "who came to suffer". Gemini is represented as twins and
shows these two characteristics of Jesus united as one as Jesus as King
and Prince. Canis Major is one of the decans. Its brightest star is also
the brightest star in the sky. That star is Sirius which means "the
Prince". This star represents Jesus as the Prince of princes. (Acts 5:31
Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for
to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.) It is no
coincidence that Sirius is the brightest star in the sky as it represents
Jesus and is bluish white in appearance. The color white shows the purity
of Jesus and blue which means separation shows Jesus separate from us as
God. Sirius can even occasionally be seen during the daytime sharing the
sky with the sun which also represents Jesus in his full glory. Sirius has
a small white dwarf companion which represents the bride of Jesus in the
church.

Cancer represents Jesus as our protector showing that once a person
is saved they cannot lose their salvation. It shows Jesus as the place of
our rest. Ursa Major which contains the Big Dipper is one of the decans of
Cancer. Dubeh its brightest star means "a flock" show us as sheep
protected by our Shepherd Jesus. Mizar in the Big Dipper means "small" and
its binary star Alcor means "the Lamb".

Leo shows Jesus as the victorious Lion and the Lion of the tribe of
Judah. (Revelation 5:5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not:
behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed
to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.) Jesus is the true
Lion with Satan only as a weak imitator. The slaughtered Lamb has become
the reigning victorious Lion as the gospel in the stars is completed from
Jesus' virgin birth to his becoming the suffering Lamb to his reign as
King of kings. A fuller understanding of the gospel in the stars can be
found in several books on the subject that will give many more meanings to
the stars that I do not have time for in this sermon. God laid out his
plan of redemption for man in the night sky for all to see with the gospel
in the stars from day four of creation even before Adam and Eve were
created and sinned as he as God knew they would and as a loving God he
already had a plan for their salvation. The next time you look at the
stars in the night sky you will now know the true story behind their
meaning as God has always given the gospel of his Son to all people so
that they are without excuse. For anyone who is not saved we can clearly
see the gospel in our King James Bible and I plead for you to call upon
Jesus today so that you can have Jesus as your Saviour and King.
