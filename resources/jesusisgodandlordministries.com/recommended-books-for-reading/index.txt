Recommended Books for Reading

(There are many other great books not listed. Make sure these books or any
others do not take away from reading and studying your King James Bible
first and foremost.)

King James Bible

All books by Dr. Gail Riplinger especially In Awe of Thy Word, New Age
Bible Versions, The Language of the King James Bible, and The Dictionary
Inside the King James Bible. Great books and cd's on the defense of the
King James Bible. Highly recommend. You can buy them at her website
http://avpublications.com.

All books by David W. Daniels of Chick Publications. He has many books on
the defense of the King James Bible. They are available at chick.com. He
also has many vlogs about the King James Bible.

All books by Dr. Grant R. Jeffrey. Can be bought at his website
grantjeffrey.com or other bookstores. (Most use the King James Bible.)

Number in Scripture by E.W. Bullinger

Color in Scripture by D.L. Higginbotham (Mostly uses the King James
Bible.)

Biblical Mathematics by Pastor Ed Vallowe

A Woman Rides the Beast by Dave Hunt (Shows the connection of the Roman
Catholic Church to the beast of Revelation and its connection with Satan
and evil and how the Roman Catholic Church has persecuted true Christians
since their beginning. May be bought at chick.com.)

Understanding Roman Catholicism: 37 Roman Catholic Doctrines Explained by
Rick Jones. (Explains some of the many false doctrines of Roman
Catholicism. A handy book to give to a precious Roman Catholic soul to
show them the truth. May be bought at http://chick.com.)

Unholy Communion:The Alien Abduction Phenomenon, Where It Originates And
How It Stops by David Ruffino (Book showing the connection of UFO
abductions to Satanic origin and how when one is saved, the abductions
stop. When one calls out the name Jesus, the abduction stops. Jesus stops
it. Scripture is King James Bible.)

Cosmic Codes: Hidden Messages From The Edge Of Eternity by Dr. Chuck
Missler. Available at his website https://khouse.org/.

Alien Encounters: The Secret Behind the UFO Phenomenon by Dr. Chuck
Missler available at https://khouse.org/. (Shows connection of UFO's to
Satan.)

Fallen: The Sons of God and the Nephilim by Tim Chaffey available at
http://midwestapologetics.org/shop/ and soon on his website
https://risenmin.com/ for his ministry Risen Ministries. (This book shows
how the sons of God in Genesis 6:2-4 are fallen angels who mated with
women and produced giants. This is the correct interpretation of
scripture, even though it is not popular. It allows proper understanding
of other scripture and is relevant to events of today. The sole purpose
for the angels to mate with women was to try and corrupt all of mankind so
that Jesus could not come as a man to be our sinless Saviour. Well done
except for the fact that Tim does not use the King James Bible. Even
though I disagree with a few things, I agree with most of what he says and
highly recommend it for one interested in this subject.)

All books by Voice of the Martyrs that have stories of persecuted
Christians such as Tortured for Christ, I am N, and Hearts of Fire. Many
individual books on stories from restricted nations persecuting Christians
such as China, India, and North Korea. Available at
https://www.persecution.com/. Scripture is not King James Bible.

He Came To Set The Captives Free by Dr. Rebecca Brown (About spiritual
warfare based on an individual who was rescued from Satanism by receiving
Jesus as her Saviour. Scripture is King James Bible.)

The Genesis Flood by Dr. Henry Morris and Dr. John C. Whitcomb (Great
detail on the Genesis flood of Noah's day and showing how it explains
findings on earth and verifies a young earth creation.)

The "Errors" in the King James Bible by Dr. Peter S. Ruckman (Explains
verses in the King James Bible that people claim were translated
incorrectly and shows that the King James Bible is 100% accurate and God's
holy words.)

The Book of Bible Problems by Dr. Gerardus D. Bouw (Another great book
that explains verses in the King James Bible that people claim were
translated incorrectly and shows that the King James Bible is 100%
accurate and God's holy words. Shows people just were interpreting them
wrong.)

Is our English Bible Inspired? by Dr. Sam Gipp (A great book available at
his website samgipp.com.)

King James Bible's Built In Dictionary by Barry Goddard (Shows how the
King James Bible self defines its own words without the help of a worldly
dictionary. Available at http://avpublications.com.)

By Divine Order and King James Code both by Pastor Michael Hoggard. (These
books show how the King James Bible is 100% inspired and 100% accurate by
showing how God the Holy Ghost has placed number patterns in scripture
that are not found in any other version. No man could do it. Great books.
Pastor Hoggard also has sermons available online and has many great
YouTube videos.)

Then Sings My Soul by Robert J. Morgan (History of some of the great hymns
and what inspired their being written.)

Hymn Histories by Dr. Alfred B. Smith (Another great book about the
stories behind why some of the great hymns were written. Alfred B. Smith
himself wrote some good hymns and produced the very good hymnal "Living
Hymns".)

As America Has Done To Israel by Chaplain John P. McTernan (Great book
showing how just as scripture says if we curse Israel we will be cursed
and if we bless Israel we will be blessed. Can purchase at chick.com.)

The Crucifixion and Death of a Man Called Jesus: From the Eyes of a
Physician by Dr. David A. Ball (Unfortunately does not use the King James
Bible.)

Son-Rise In The Garden Of Good & Evil by Dr. David A. Ball (Unfortunately
does not use the King James Bible.)

Books by Jeff Godwin exposing the connection of Rock and Roll music
including Christian Rock with Satan and all of its evils. Some are The
Devil's Disciples: The Truth About Rock, Dancing With Demons: The Music's
Real Master, and What's wrong With Christian Rock?

Understanding Roman Catholicism by Rick Jones (A former Roman Catholic
exposes the dangers of the world's largest cult and how its members are
being led on a path to hell by the church's many false teachings. May be
bought at chick.com.)

The King James Bible Companion by David W. Daniels (This handy little book
can be carried with your Holy Bible and helps define some of the less
common used words in the King James Bible. May be found at chick.com.)

Christ, Muhammad and I by Mohammad Al Ghazoli (A former Muslim scholar
reveals the dangers of and false religion of Islam and shows how one needs
Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour. Great book for Muslims searching
for the truth about Jesus. Available at chick.com.)

American Dictionary of the English Language [1828 Noah Webster dictionary]
(This dictionary helps define words in the King James Bible. Always use
scripture first, but this can help. Many words use scripture to define
them. This dictionary has the meanings much closer to the King James Bible
than modern dictionaries. A good resource for the serious Holy Bible
student. Available at http://avpublications.com.)

Foxe's Book of Martyrs by John Foxe (A great book about the history of
Christians being martyred (murdered/killed) for their Christian faith and
stand for Jesus. Foxe himself was persecuted and forced to leave England.)
This book has been updated by the Voice of the Martyrs to include over a
hundred stories of modern day Christian martyrs and is available at their
website www.persecution.com. The new book is called Foxe: Voices of the
Martyrs AD33-Today. All Christians should read at least one of these books
to see what it really means to be a Christian and serve the Lord.
Persecution is getting greater in the world today and especially us
American Christians who only mildly suffer (though there is an increase
happening) compared to other Christians in many places of the world need
to see that we need to support those Christians who are standing for
Jesus. They should encourage us to witness for Jesus and not fear death.
God commands us to pray for Christians in bonds. (Hebrews 13:3 Remember
them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer
adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.)

Sword of the Lord Newspaper from Sword of the Lord Ministries. This is not
a book, but a newspaper issued by an independent Baptist ministry that has
many very helpful articles for Christians. It can be purchased from their
website at https://www.swordofthelord.com/. This ministry and newspaper
uses the King James Bible.
