The New Year's resolutions that need to be kept

Today is New Year's Day and we start a new year. Many people around
the world will celebrate certain traditions today such as eating black
eyed peas or pork which supposedly will bring good luck to the person for
the New Year. Some cultures eat round food believing if the food looks
like coins and will bring them prosperity. Some believe you need to eat
twelve grapes for prosperity in the New Year. Greeks will hang onions on
their front doors and in Brazil they all wear white and go to the ocean
and jump over seven waves believing this will bring them prosperity for
the New Year. Chileans wear yellow underwear believing it will bring luck,
red underwear if looking for love, and white underwear that is said to
bring them peace. In Denmark people stand on a chair and at midnight leap
to bring in January. People shoot off fireworks and those in cold climates
will do the polar bear plunge into the frigid waters. People will watch
the ball drop at midnight in Times Square in New York City or some other
object such as a cheese head in Wisconsin. Some cultures burn effigies of
people or other items that they want removed for the New Year. Many people
will make New Year's resolutions, but most will never be kept. Resolution
means a promise to do what you said you would. It is estimated that 23% of
the people quit their resolution before the end of the first week with
only 36% making it past the first month and then most of them failing
before the year is out. Only 9% are said to actually fulfill their New
Year's Day resolutions. Many will plan to quit smoking or drinking, to
lose weight, to start exercising, sleep more, get more money, or get a new
job during the year. Now while it is a good thing to eat healthy and to
exercise and to plan for the year, we need to remember as we are told in
James that we are not in control of our lives even though we think we are.
God is the one in control and he tells us to be saved because we have no
guarantee for tomorrow. (James 4:14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on
the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for
a little time, and then vanisheth away.) Many of those who are around at
the start of the New Year will be dead before the year ends which is why
everyone needs to make sure they are saved today if they are not already
saved. New Year's Day resolutions can be traced all the way back to the
Babylonians about 4,000 years ago on their feast day of Akitu. They made
promises to their gods and unlike most people today who as we saw do not
keep their resolutions, the Babylonians did as they made the promises to
gods and were afraid of not keeping them and losing favor with the gods.
Some of the promises they made were repaying debts or returning borrowed
farm equipment. Many cultures continue with their own New Year's Day
resolutions. As we saw many of the things associated with New Year's Day
such as what they eat, what they wear, and the things they do are often
associated with bringing them luck, prosperity, and health in the coming
New Year. People need to understand that there is no such thing as luck as
this removes God from the picture. The person relies on some object or
something they did rather than on God. What we eat or wear for New Year's
Day will make no difference as to how the coming year will go. If people
truly want peace and health for the New Year then they need to get saved,
trust in God, and live for the Lord. This does not mean that they are
guaranteed to survive the whole year or not have any health problems, but
if they are saved they will be able to get through those problems much
easier and if they do die they can have comfort in knowing they will be in
heaven with Jesus. Instead of making New Year's Day resolutions that are
about themselves that most will never keep and will never benefit their
eternal souls, then they need to make resolutions for God such as
attending church for all services, praying daily, daily Bible reading, and
witnessing for the Lord. Then remember that you are making a promise
before God and so you need to fulfill those promises. Do not let the
heathen such as the Babylonians have more respect for their false gods
than you do for the one true living God.

Some of the ways that a person can fulfill New Year's resolutions for
God is to make church and other Christians a part of their new life. The
people you need to be hanging around should be other Christians,
preferably ones who are strong in their walk with God. They can help keep
you accountable to fulfill your resolutions you made to God. They will
also help encourage you in attending church the way you should. As I said
this should include all services unless it is just not possible on an
occasion such as being very sick. Even if you are on vacation then still
attend a godly church if there is one available. Too many Christians think
that as long as they go to the Morning Worship service then they are good
for the week. They will make sure they attend all high school football
games or some other event such as see a movie every week on a certain day,
but they will not attend all church services as they do not see the same
priority. They skip Sunday School believing it is only for children when
that is far from the truth. Just as many adults and often times even more
so than children, then adults need to have Sunday School in order to teach
them Bible basics. The Evening Service will complete the worship of the
Lord's Day. This is supposed to be a day of rest and worshipping of God
and it does not end after the first service. The Wednesday midweek service
is also essential as it will give you that pick me up that is often needed
in the middle of the week as we deal with the stress of work. The midweek
service also allows a time of prayer and more Bible study. This is often
the time you can learn the most and grow as a Christian. The closer you
get to God through your other resolutions of prayer and Bible reading and
study then the easier it will be to fulfill the resolution of attending
all of the church services as you will want to worship God and will want
to spend time with God's people. By keeping your closest friends as people
in the church or other saved people from other godly churches then you
will continue to grow and will again want to go to church rather than
going to the beach with an unsaved coworker. Invite that unsaved coworker
to church and even volunteer to pick them up.

Christians need to learn to pray daily not only for their food, but
also spend some time in prayer with the Lord. The more prayer throughout
the day the better things will be. You should pray when you get up in the
morning to start your day off right, pray for safety going to work, at
work, and going home. Pray again before going to sleep so that it will
help bring you a better night's sleep. God told us to pray without ceasing
so prayer needs to become a part of your life and not just a temporary
thing or only when you need something from God. (I Thessalonians 5:17 Pray
without ceasing.) (Psalm 145:18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call
upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.) (Jeremiah 33:3 Call unto
me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which
thou knowest not.) Christians need to stop treating God as if he was some
genie who is supposed to answer all of our wishes. When we pray we need to
believe that God can and will answer the prayer as long as we are not
asking something that we know is a sin. (Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto
you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive
them, and ye shall have them.) (Psalm 66:18 If I regard iniquity in my
heart, the Lord will not hear me🙂 The more you pray then the more you will
want to pray as prayer is just talking to God. The closer we get to God
the closer we will want to continue to get. Prayer is like exercise and it
must be done daily as it does not take long to get out of the habit when
you stop for a few days. The same applies to church. You make some excuse
why you cannot go to this service and before long you start always
skipping that service as Satan will whisper in your ear that it is not
necessary. First it will be the midweek service and then Sunday night,
then Sunday School and the Morning Worship will also cease as you stop
attending church all together. Do not let Satan inhibit your prayer life.
Whenever you feel like you want to stop praying then that is the very
moment that you need to pray and ask God to keep Satan away from you and
to keep you on a path of righteousness. When praying it is best if you
have a quiet place. Jesus mentioned a prayer closet though it does not
have to be a literal closet, just somewhere where you will not be
disturbed and can be alone with God. (Matthew 6:6 But thou, when thou
prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to
thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall
reward thee openly.) The point Jesus was making was to be sincere in your
prayers and not just doing them so everyone can see you praying. 

All Christians need to have daily Bible reading of the King James
Bible for those who speak and read the English language. This daily Bible
reading should not be rushed so make sure you intentionally set apart time
each day just for Bible reading. If you plan this as a part of your day
just as you do work, sleep, and eating then the time will not be used for
something else and you will not as likely get out of the habit. Find a
quiet place to read. It is best if you can do your daily reading after you
first get up in the morning following your prayers. This way you day will
start off on the right foot. This may mean getting up earlier than you
used to. If you have to read at night then do it before watching TV or
doing the other things you do at night such as play board games or work on
jigsaw puzzles or spend time with the family. If you have a family then
the dad can have a short family devotional and then instruct the rest of
the family to read their Bible. Before reading your Bible then ask the
Holy Ghost to give you an understanding and then read from the beginning
or at least read an entire book. Reading from the beginning will give you
the best understanding as things in other books often relate to an earlier
book. If not saved then start in the gospel of John or Romans and read
them through. Do not just randomly flip through your Bible each day and
then just read a few verses. You will never grow this way as you will not
learn as you have no pattern to your reading and never get the whole
picture. Make sure you read at least several chapters so that you should
be able to read through the entire Bible at least once every year. You can
find schedules for this or make your own. Take your time and study God's
word by comparing scripture with scripture and not just speed read through
it so you can check Bible reading off of your list saying you have
fulfilled your New Year's resolution. This type of reading will eventually
lead to you quitting as you will not learn anything and will feel you are
just wasting your time, which for the most part you are as you will get
very little out of it. The same applies to going to church, but never
listening to the pastor as you are too busy playing on your phone or when
you pray as fast as you can so that you can do quote "fun" things. God
commands us to read his word daily and to study his word and not just
speed read through it. (II Timothy 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved
unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the
word of truth.) (II Timothy 3:16-17 16 All scripture is given by
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness:
17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good
works.) (John 5:39 ¶ Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have
eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.) If we obey God's
commands then we will look forward to our daily Bible reading and getter
closer to God. A better Bible reading will help with you following through
with prayer and attending all of the church services. Daily Bible reading
will bring good changes to your life as you will most likely sin less. Let
daily Bible reading become a habit that is good unlike the bad habits of
smoking or drinking. This is one habit you never want to give up. Let the
light of God's word shine in your life.    

If you have been fulfilling your resolutions in attending all church
services every week, praying daily and reading God's word daily then you
will be more likely to fulfill your last resolution of witnessing for the
Lord. The closer you get with God as you fulfill the other resolutions
then you will see how important it is in winning souls for God. Scripture
even calls those who do as being wise. (Proverbs 11:30 The fruit of the
righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.) The more
you understand God's word and the more you pray then the more you will see
that we live in a lost and dying world and that we must witness to those
lost before it is eternally too late. You will start to have a concern for
those around you as you go about your lives wondering if they are saved or
not. Since we cannot tell if a stranger is saved just by looking at them
then we need to assume everyone is not saved and give them the gospel. If
you are scared to talk to people then ask God to help you. This can be
done during your prayer time. An easy way to witness is to hand a person a
tract or leave it in some location that it will be found. It is not for
you to worry whether it gets read or not. That is God the Holy Ghost's job
to convict them. We are to just plant the seed as God said his word would
not return void. (Isaiah 55:11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of
my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that
which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.)
Someone will read it even if the tract gets discarded by the original
person. As you get more confidant and realize how close we are to the end
and how many die each day and go to hell then you will be able to start a
conversation with people. You can also win souls by writing a book,
starting a website, or posting on social media a daily verse about Jesus.
There are many other ways that we can reach the lost and your fellow
Christians or your pastor can help. Get the church involved in supporting
missionaries or in other ways to get the unsaved to church so they can
hear the gospel. Do not leave soul winning up to just the pastor. We all
must be involved. We are in a spiritual war against Satan for these lost
souls. Do not let him win.

As we celebrate New Year's Day today, then instead of making
resolutions that will have no impact on your soul, let us make resolutions
that will honor God by becoming closer to him and winning the lost.
Remember that a resolution means promise to do something and this is
basically a vow and God said it was better to never make a vow then to not
fulfill it. (Ecclesiastes 5:5 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow,
than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.) Let us make sure we fulfill our
vow to God so that he is pleased. (Numbers 30:2 If a man vow a vow unto
the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not
break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his
mouth.) If you fulfill those resolutions that we spoke of with sincerity
then you will not need to make any new resolutions next year except to
continue to win even more souls for Jesus and to become even closer to
God. I pray that all of those listening will fulfill these resolutions and
have a blessed year along with safety and health. For those who are
unsaved, let today be the day you get saved and let this new year become
the best year of your life as you start a new life with Jesus. Call upon
Jesus today.
