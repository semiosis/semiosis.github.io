Moses as a type of Jesus

Moses the great leader of Israel, the man of God, was a type of
Jesus. Moses wrote the first five books of scripture [Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy] and Psalm 90. Moses said that God would
raise up a Prophet like unto him. (Deuteronomy 18:15 ¶ The LORD thy God
will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren,
like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;) (Deuteronomy 18:18 I will raise
them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put
my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall
command him.) The life of Moses greatly paralleled the life of Jesus as we
will see.

Both Moses and Jesus were born at a time when Israel was under
foreign control, Moses while Israel was controlled by Egypt and Jesus
while Israel was under the control of the Roman Empire. Both Moses and
Jesus had their lives spared while young as the rulers wanted them dead.
Pharaoh ordered all of the male children born to be killed. (Exodus 1:22
And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye
shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.) The
life of Moses was spared when his mom placed him into an ark of bulrushes
and placed him into the river where Pharaoh's daughter rescued him and
raised him as her own son. The ark Moses was placed in was symbolic of the
safety that Noah and his family had in the ark during the Genesis flood in
which Jesus dwelt inside with them. People are also safe inside the arms
of Jesus. Joseph fled with Mary and Jesus to Egypt to escape king Herod
who ordered all male children under two years old to be killed in order to
try and kill Jesus so he could not take Herod's throne as King of the
Jews. (Matthew 2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the
Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young
child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring
thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.) Both Moses
and Jesus spent some of their childhood in Egypt and came out of Egypt.
Moses lived in Egypt until he was 40 and Jesus from about the age of 2
until the death of Herod. Both Moses and Jesus were raised without
biological dads; Moses by the daughter of Pharaoh and Jesus was adopted by
Joseph who was his stepdad. Moses and Jesus both spent time in the
wilderness before starting their ministries as they were called by God.
Moses after leaving Egypt spent 40 years in the wilderness tending the
sheep of his father in law Jethro. Jesus after being baptized by John the
Baptist was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the
devil. (Matthew 4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the
wilderness to be tempted of the devil.) Moses had been a shepherd before
starting his calling by God. (Exodus 3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of
Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to
the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to
Horeb.) Jesus is the good shepherd. (John 10:11 I am the good shepherd:
the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.)

Moses had dealings with the wicked Pharaoh during the ten plagues
while freeing Israel and Jesus had to deal with the wicked king Herod.
(Luke 13:31 ¶ The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying
unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.)
Neither feared the king. (Hebrews 11:27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not
fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is
invisible.) (Luke 13:32 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox,
Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the
third day I shall be perfected.)

Moses fasted for 40 days alone before God gave him the ten
commandments and Jesus fasted for 40 days alone in the wilderness while
being tempted by Satan. (Exodus 34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty
days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he
wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.)
(Matthew 4:2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
afterward an hungred.)

Moses and Jesus had to deal with people who hardened their hearts.
Moses dealt with Pharaoh. (Exodus 8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was
respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD
had said.) Jesus had to deal with his own apostle's hearts hardening. We
as Christians need to be careful that our hearts do not harden. (Mark 6:52
For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was
hardened.)

Moses climbed mount Sinai to receive the law and Jesus went up into a
mountain and preached the sermon on the mount. (Exodus 31:18 ¶ And he gave
unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount
Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger
of God.) (Matthew 5:1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a
mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:) Both Moses
and Jesus have a connection to the law. Moses received the ten
commandments from God. Jesus actually wrote the law for Moses and came as
a man to fulfill the law. (Matthew 5:17 ¶ Think not that I am come to
destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to
fulfil.)

Moses and Jesus both wrote. Moses wrote down the words of the
covenant between God and Israel. (Exodus 34:27 And the LORD said unto
Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have
made a covenant with thee and with Israel.) Jesus wrote words on the
ground before the men who accused the adulteress woman. (John 8:6 This
they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus
stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard
them not.)

Both Moses and Jesus performed miracles either to or on large bodies
of water. Moses parted the Red sea and Jesus calmed the sea while a great
storm was happening. (Mark 4:39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and
said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a
great calm.) Moses performed miracles such as bringing forth water from a
rock and Jesus performed many miracles such as he gave sight to the blind,
hearing to the deaf, raised the dead to life, fed thousands, and many
other miracles.

Both fed hungry people in a wilderness. Moses appealed to God when
the people murmured against him saying they were hungry and God gave the
people manna and quails. Jesus fed 5,000 one time and 4,000 another time.
Both gave water to the people. Moses struck a rock to bring forth water
for the people. (Exodus 17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon
the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come
water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight
of the elders of Israel.) Jesus as the living water will give living water
to all those who thirst spiritually and life everlasting. (John 4:14 But
whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst;
but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water
springing up into everlasting life.)

Both men had ministries to Israel. Moses led the Israelites out of
Egypt and led them in the wilderness. Jesus came to bring salvation to
Israel and all mankind. (Acts 13:26 Men and brethren, children of the
stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word
of this salvation sent.)

Both men were envied and hated. (Psalm 106:16 They envied Moses also
in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.) The people rebelled against
Moses as they wanted to be him. People were jealous of Moses. Jesus was
delivered up for death because of envy in the people. The Pharisees were
jealous of Jesus and were afraid of losing their power. (Matthew 27:18 For
he knew that for envy they had delivered him.) Satan rebelled against the
Godhead including Jesus when Satan wanted to be God.

Moses and Jesus both spoke face to face with God. God spoke many
times to Moses such as at the burning bush and on mount Sinai. God spoke
to Jesus at times such as at his baptism and when Jesus prayed that his
name be glorified again. (John 12:28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came
there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will
glorify it again.)

Both men suffered disgrace. Moses was brought up as the son of
Pharaoh's daughter and would have been in the line to become pharaoh.
Moses threw all of that away to become disgraced in the eyes of Pharaoh in
order to lead his people out of Egypt. (Hebrews 11:24-25 By faith Moses,
when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's
daughter;
25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to
enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;) Jesus was disgraced when as an
innocent man he died on the cross for our sins. He became a curse for us
so that we might have everlasting life. (Hebrews 12:2 Looking unto Jesus
the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before
him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right
hand of the throne of God.)

Moses delivered Israel from Egypt and slavery and Jesus delivered
those in paradise to a place in heaven and delivered all of those who call
upon him for salvation from spiritual death and spiritual slavery due to
sin and the consequences of it. (Ephesians 4:8 Wherefore he saith, When he
ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.)
(Romans 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;)
(Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
life through Jesus Christ our Lord.)

Moses was a meek man, more than all those on the earth. [Numbers 12:3
(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the
face of the earth.)] Jesus was also a meek, humble man who said he would
take on the burdens of people. (Matthew 11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and
learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto
your souls.) Jesus humbled himself when as God he became a man that he
might die on the cross for our sins and bring salvation to the world.
(Philippians 2:8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself,
and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.)

Moses acted as an intercessor or mediator between God and the people
of Israel. God wanted to destroy Israel and then start a new nation with
Moses but Moses said he would rather have his name removed from the book
of life and go to hell for eternity than to have God not keep his word to
preserve Israel. (Exodus 32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin-;
and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast
written.) Jesus as only he as the God-man can do is the intercessor for us
before God. Jesus was willing to die on the cross for us in order to be
our intercessor. (Hebrews 7:25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to
the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
intercession for them.)

Moses was not recognized by his own people. (Acts 7:25 For he
supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would
deliver them: but they understood not.) Jesus was also not recognized by
his own people. (John 1:10-11 10 He was in the world, and the world was
made by him, and the world knew him not.
11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.) Jesus was rejected
by those he had created.

Moses and Jesus were both faithful. (Hebrews 3:2 Who was faithful to
him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.)
Moses was faithful as a servant, but Jesus was faithful as the Son of God.
Jesus always did the will of God the Father.

The people grumbled about Moses and his leadership. (Numbers 14:2 And
all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and
the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the
land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!) Jesus was
also murmured at by the people because they did not like his teachings.
This happens still today against preachers who preach God's word. (John
6:41 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which
came down from heaven.)

Moses sent out twelve spies to the Promised Land and Jesus sent out
the twelve apostles to preach about him. Moses and Jesus were both
prophets and priests. Both were kings. Jesus is King of kings and Moses
was king of Jeshurun. (Deuteronomy 33:5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when
the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.)
(I Timothy 6:15 Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and
only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;) Both men were
judges and teachers. (Deuteronomy 4:5 Behold, I have taught you statutes
and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so
in the land whither ye go to possess it.) (John 3:2 The same came to Jesus
by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come
from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be
with him.) (Exodus 18:13 ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses
sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning
unto the evening.) (Revelation 19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a
white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in
righteousness he doth judge and make war.)

Both Moses and Jesus had raised and outstretched arms with two men
beside them and a war going on. Moses while fighting the Amalekites had
Aaron and Hur beside him who held his arms up. Jesus while hanging on the
cross had two thieves beside him all while a spiritual war was going on.
(Exodus 17:12 But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put
it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,
the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands
were steady until the going down of the sun.) (Matthew 27:38 Then were
there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another
on the left.)

Moses and Jesus were together at the mount of transfiguration.(Matthew
17:4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to
be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee,
and one for Moses, and one for Elias.)

Both had people weep over their deaths and both had disputes and
controversies over their bodies as well as important individuals
interested in their bodies. (Deuteronomy 34:8 ¶ And the children of Israel
wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping
and mourning for Moses were ended.) (Mark 16:10 And she went and told them
that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.) Michael the archangel
disputed over the body of Moses with Satan. (Jude 9 Yet Michael the
archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of
Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The
Lord rebuke thee.) Joseph of Arimathaea who was a member of the council
wanted the body of Jesus. (Mark 15:43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable
counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in
boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.)

God told Moses to make a fiery serpent out of brass and set it upon a
pole and that whenever someone was bitten by a fiery serpent if they
looked at the one on the pole they would live. (Numbers 21:8 And the LORD
said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it
shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon
it, shall live.) Jesus said that the brasen fiery serpent represented him
on the cross as just as the serpent was cursed so was he. (Genesis 3:14
And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou
art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy
belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:)
(Galatians 3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being
made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth
on a tree:) Those who look to Jesus and his death on the cross will live,
those who do not will die and spend eternity in the lake of fire. (John
3:14 ¶ And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of man be lifted up:)

Both kept the passover and Jesus became the passover lamb. (I
Corinthians 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new
lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for
us:) Both dealt with lepers. Jesus healed the lepers and Moses' sister
Miriam became a leper after she challenged the authority of Moses.
(Numbers 12:10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and,
behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon
Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.) (Luke 7:22 Then Jesus answering
said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and
heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the
deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.) Both
Moses and Jesus sang. Moses sang after the victory at the Red sea and
Jesus sang a hymn after the last supper. (Exodus 15:1 Then sang Moses and
the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will
sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his
rider hath he thrown into the sea.) (Mark 14:26 ¶ And when they had sung
an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.) Both had connections to
innocent blood. God gave Moses the laws concerning innocent blood. Jesus
an innocent man shed his blood for you and me and the whole world.
(Matthew 27:4 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent
blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.)

Moses was offered the world but refused it. He was an heir to the
throne of Pharaoh and at the time Egypt was a world power and Moses could
have had it all. He chose God over the world and so should we. Jesus was
offered the kingdoms of the world if he would have only bowed down to
Satan and worshipped him. (Luke 4:5-7 5 And the devil, taking him up into
an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a
moment of time.
6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the
glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I
give it.
7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.) Jesus refused
and someday Jesus will rule this world and Satan will bow down to him.

Both spoke of eternal fire; Moses on the altar and Jesus the fires of
hell. (Matthew 23:33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye
escape the damnation of hell?) Both paid tribute. (Numbers 31:41 And Moses
gave the tribute, which was the LORD'S heave offering, unto Eleazar the
priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.) Jesus paid tribute for him and Peter
when Peter got the coin from the mouth of the fish. (Matthew 17:27
Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast
an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast
opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give
unto them for me and thee.) Both told wicked men to depart or to depart
from the wicked. (Numbers 16:26 And he spake unto the congregation,
saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch
nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.) (Matthew 7:23
And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye
that work iniquity.) Both spoke of future tribulation. (Deuteronomy 4:30
When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee,
even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be
obedient unto his voice;) Jesus often spoke of the coming great
tribulation. (Matthew 24:21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as
was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall
be.)

Moses and Jesus were called God's servants. (Numbers 12:7 My servant
Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.) Jesus is the Son of
God yet he became a servant of God as a man. (Matthew 12:18 Behold my
servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased:
I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the
Gentiles.) We all need to be servants of God.

Moses was clearly a type of Jesus. Many others things could be added.
Jesus was always greater than Moses. Jesus was the Prophet like unto Moses
that Moses spoke about. Many thought John the Baptist was when they asked
him if he was that prophet. This was what they were referring to. (John
1:21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am
not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.) The people were told to
hear this Prophet which is Jesus. (Acts 3:22 For Moses truly said unto the
fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your
brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he
shall say unto you.) (Acts 7:37 ¶ This is that Moses, which said unto the
children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of
your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.) If anyone today who is
listening is not saved, then please hear this Prophet. Seek Jesus as the
people were looking for him when John the Baptist came. Jesus said he is
the only way to life. (John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the
truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.) Call upon
him today before it is too late.
