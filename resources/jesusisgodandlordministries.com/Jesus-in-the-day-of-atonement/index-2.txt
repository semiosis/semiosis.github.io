Jesus in the day of atonement

The day of atonement, or Yom Kippur as it is known in Israel today,
is considered the holiest day of the year by Jews. Jews who never go to
synagogue will go on this day. Yom means day and Kippur means atonement or
covering. The day of atonement is on 10 Tishri the seventh month on the
Jewish calendar or in September or October of our calendar. (Leviticus
23:27 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of
atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict
your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.) The ten
days from the feast of trumpets to the day of atonement are considered
high holy days and are supposed to be days of repentance. These days are
known as the Days of Awe. The Jews believe the day of atonement is the day
that God will judge them and see if their good deeds or works outweighs
their bad deeds. If they do, the Jews believe their name will remain in
the book of life for another year. I mentioned in my sermon Jesus in the
feast of trumpets how a Jew or anyone can have their name written in the
book of life for all eternity just by calling on Jesus to save them and be
their Saviour. (Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the
Lord shall be saved.) The day of atonement was to be a day of fasting and
prayer. There is debate on if fasting is required. Acts speaks of the day
of atonement as "fast", but this could just be that it was so common to
fast due to tradition that the day became known as the fast. (Acts 27:9
Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because
the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,) It was a holy day in
which no work was done. The soul that worked was to be cut off and
destroyed from his people. This was a serious day. (Leviticus 23:26-32 ¶
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
27 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of
atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict
your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement,
to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day,
he shall be cut off from among his people.
30 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the
same soul will I destroy from among his people.
31 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
32 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your
souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall
ye celebrate your sabbath.) It was important that the day of atonement was
a day of rest as only those who were resting in Christ's righteousness by
faith alone would experience the true rest of Jesus. Only those who truly
trust in Jesus as their Saviour by faith alone will have rest as they have
been redeemed of their sins. (Hebrews 4:10-11 For he that is entered into
his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall
after the same example of unbelief.) (Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye
saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.)   

Today Jews read the book of Jonah at the synagogue as a reminder of
God's mercy and forgiveness. When the temple was destroyed in A.D. 70 the
Jews could no longer do animal sacrifices. They replaced the animal
sacrifices with prayer, good works, and charitable donations thinking this
will save them. It will not. Only the shed blood of Jesus Christ will save
the Jew and everyone else. Even today most Jews spend most of the day in
prayer asking God to forgive them, but without any true repentance that is
needed for salvation. Scripture is clear that blood is needed for the
sacrifice in order to be forgiven. This is why the animal sacrifices were
done as representative of the blood of Jesus for our sins. (Leviticus
17:11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to
you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the
blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.) (Hebrews 9:22 And almost all
things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is
no remission.) Jews need to realize that there is one greater than the
temple by the name Jesus (Yeshua) who is the only one who can save you.
(Matthew 12:6 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than
the temple.)

In Biblical days the high priest would enter the most holy place
[holy of holies] on the day of atonement. This was the only day of the
year that the high priest or anyone could enter the most holy place.
Before entering the most holy place, the high priest had to wash himself
and put on holy garments. The high priest would take two goats and casts
lots to see which one would be sacrificed. The other one was put aside and
was known as the scapegoat. The high priest had to sacrifice a bullock for
his own sins and then would sacrifice the goat for the LORD as a sin
offering for the people of Israel. This blood was placed on the mercy seat
of the ark of the covenant. The scapegoat was released into the wilderness
and it was said that the sins of the people were placed on this goat never
to return back to the people. (Leviticus 16:4-19 He shall put on the holy
linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall
be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be
attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in
water, and so put them on.
5 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids
of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for
himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.
7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and
the other lot for the scapegoat.
9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and offer
him for a sin offering.
10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be
presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let
him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.
11 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for
himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and
shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:
12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the
altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small,
and bring it within the vail:
13 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the
cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony,
that he die not:
14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his
finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he
sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.

15 ¶ Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the
people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he
did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat,
and before the mercy seat:
16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the
uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions
in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the
congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he
goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and
have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the
congregation of Israel.
18 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an
atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the
blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times,
and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of
Israel.) A thick veil [curtain] separated the holy place from the most
holy place to keep people out of the most holy place except for the high
priest and only on the day of atonement. This veil tore at the death of
Jesus on the cross for our sins as now true believers who are priests can
have access to Jesus every day and not just on the day of atonement.
(Matthew 27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from
the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;) (Mark
15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
bottom.) Jesus Christ is our High Priest. (Hebrews 3:1 Wherefore, holy
brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High
Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;) Jesus as the High Priest placed
his blood on the mercy seat in heaven as the final sacrifice for our sins
and full forgiveness for all who will call upon Jesus as their Saviour.
(Hebrews 9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own
blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
redemption for us.) Jesus not only offered the sacrifice, but he was the
sacrifice. (Hebrews 7:27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to
offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for
this he did once, when he offered up himself.) I mentioned this in a
previous sermon how a Christian man Ron Wyatt had found the ark of the
covenant buried under the location of Jesus' cross and how the blood of
Jesus went through the cracks in the ground from the earthquake at his
death and landed on the mercy seat of the ark of the covenant. Jesus not
only completed things in heaven, but also as High Priest here on earth by
placing his blood on the mercy seat here as well just as the Israelite
high priest did on the day of atonement. Jesus completed the work of
forgiveness for our sins and no more animal sacrifices were needed. Unlike
the Israelite high priest who had to make a sacrifice for his sins first
and then the peoples, Jesus never needed to make a sacrifice for himself
since he was sinless. (Hebrews 4:15 For we have not an high priest which
cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all
points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.) All believers may now
enter the holy place in heaven due to the blood of Jesus. (Hebrews 10:19
Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the
blood of Jesus,) Jesus made one sacrifice never to be repeated unlike the
Israelite priest who had to make them every year on the day of atonement.
(Hebrews 9:25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high
priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;)
(Hebrews 9:28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and
unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin
unto salvation.) Jesus is the High Priest in heaven in the real holy place
unlike the Israelite high priest. (Hebrews 9:24 For Christ is not entered
into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true;
but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:)
Jesus as God humbled himself for us on the cross in order to pay for our
sins. (Philippians 2:8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.)
None of us can pay for our own sins whether by good works or living right
or any other means, therefore Jesus died for us.

All of Israel will be saved on the day of atonement at the end of the
tribulation, which is also the end of the 70^th week of Daniel, when they
look upon Jesus whom they have pierced. (Zechariah 12:10 And I will pour
upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit
of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have
pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son,
and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his
firstborn.) (Romans 11:25-27
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery,
lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is
happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
26 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come
out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
27 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.)
All Israel will shout "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the LORD"
when they see Jesus. (Psalm 118:26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name
of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.) (Matthew
23:39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall
say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.)

Just as the trumpet is sounded for the rapture of the bride of Jesus
to meet him in the air on the feast of trumpets, the trumpet is sounded
again on the day of atonement. The Israelites were to sound the trumpet on
this day. (Leviticus 25:9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile
to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement
shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.) Two of the many
reasons that the trumpet was sounded in Biblical days were for a call to
assemble and another was for Israel to move out. The trumpet will sound
once again to announce the coming of Jesus at the end of the tribulation
on the day of atonement and Jesus will finally gather all of Israel to him
as the whole nation gets saved as they look upon Jesus whom they have
pierced. He will then move them into the literal thousand year Millennial
kingdom.    

In conclusion the day of atonement is the day to show all Jews that
they are sinners in need of a Saviour and that Jesus is that Saviour. The
day of atonement also points Jews to the second coming of Jesus at the
conclusion of the tribulation. May all Jews as well as anyone listening
who is not saved call upon Jesus today and have Jesus be the atonement for
your sins and to come back with him at his second coming to meet the now
repentant saved Jewish nation. (Revelation 19:14 And the armies which were
in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and
clean.) The feast of trumpets and the day of atonement remind us that
Jesus is coming soon.
