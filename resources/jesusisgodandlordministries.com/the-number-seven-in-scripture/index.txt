The Number Seven in Scripture

Even the casual reader of scripture will notice the frequency of the
number seven and realize there must be a reason. The number seven is found
many times not only by the word seven mentioned, but also in many places
that are not as obvious. The number seven in scripture means completeness
or spiritual perfection. This number is used by God to show he is
finished. Often times the number seven is used in conjunction with other
numbers matching their significance.

The number seven is first seen with the seven days of creation and
thus even today we have a seven day week. Some governments over the years
have tried to go against God's word and his perfect design and have a ten
day week or something else, but always go back to the seven day week.

We see in Genesis chapter 7 the flood destroying the earth. God was
showing his complete judgment on the pre-flood world. God commanded Noah
to bring the animals into the ark. He brought the rain after seven days.
Noah brought seven of each clean animal. Noah waited seven days after the
dove returned to send it out again and then waited seven more days to send
it out a third time. The ark rested in the seventh month upon the
mountains of Ararat. Noah's name is mentioned for the seventh time in
Genesis 6:9 where it says Noah was a just man and perfect in his
generations. This matches the perfection of the number seven. The seventh
book of the Holy Bible is Judges which also deals with judgment of God's
people. 

In Revelation we see the number seven frequently. There are the seven
churches in Asia, seven spirits which are before his throne, seven golden
candlesticks, and seven stars in chapter 1. At the end of each of the
churches, Jesus gives seven different promises to each of the churches to
those who overcome. Revelation mentions the seven seal judgments, seven
trumpet and seven vial judgments. The seven sealed book is found in
Revelation 5:1. Seven thunders are heard in heaven (Revelation 10). The
beast has seven heads and seven crowns. Revelation chapter 12 and 13
mention seven beings: the woman, the man child, the dragon or Satan,
archangel Michael, the Lamb or Jesus, the seven headed beast, and the
false prophet. Revelation 17 mentions seven mountains and seven kings.

In the gospel of John, Jesus made seven "I am" statements. Jesus
performed seven miracles in John. In Matthew chapter 13 Jesus spoke seven
parables. In Matthew and Mark we find the miracle of Jesus feeding 4,000
with seven loaves. One of the meanings of the number four is the gospel.
This shows how Jesus in his perfection gave the gospel to the 4,000. After
they were done eating they had seven full baskets left over. God's supply
never runs out. In Luke chapter 3 we see seventy seven names in the
genealogy of Jesus from God to Jesus himself. 77 is 7 x 11. Jesus healed
seven times on the sabbath.

Seven feasts are mentioned in the Old Testament for the Jews
instituted by God. They are passover, feast of unleavened bread, feast of
first fruits, Pentecost, feast of trumpets, day of atonement, and feast of
tabernacles. The feast of unleavened bread was seven days long. The feast
of trumpets was on the first day of the seventh month. The feast of
tabernacles was also in the seventh month and seven days long. The Jewish
sabbath was on the seventh day of the week.

We see the Israelites marched around Jericho for seven days and seven
times on the seventh day. They were led by seven priests with seven
trumpets. In Genesis 31, Laban pursued after Jacob for seven days. In II
Kings, Naaman who had leprosy washed in the Jordan river seven times and
was made clean. Solomon was seven years in building the temple. Jacob
bowed himself seven times before Esau when he met him in Genesis 33:3.
Jacob worked seven years each for Leah and Rachel. In Acts chapter 6,
seven men of honest report were chosen. Pharaoh's dream he told Joseph
consisted of seven kine and seven ears of corn representing seven
plenteous years and seven years of famine. (Genesis 41) Moses turned the
waters of Egypt into blood for seven days. The candlestick in the temple
had seven lamps. We see the seven sons of Jesse. God's covenant with
Abraham in Genesis 12 had seven blessings.

There are four sets of 490 years (70 x 7) in the history of Israel.
The first is from Abraham to the Exodus, the second from the exodus to the
temple, the third from the temple to the edict of Artaxerxes who allowed
the Jews to return to Jerusalem from Babylon, and the fourth from
Artaxerxes to the second coming of Jesus. Note that all four of these have
gaps in them as God does not count the time that Israel was in captivity
or in the last case, the gap continues as we are in the time of the
gentiles and it will continue until the signing of the peace treaty by the
antichrist with Israel.

The phrase "Thus saith the LORD of Hosts" is found seventy times in
scripture. That is 7 x 10. This shows God's word is perfect and cannot be
changed. The phrase "his servants the prophets" is found seven times with
the last two times being in verse 7 of that chapter.  The phrase "ark of
the covenant" is found 42 times (7 x 6) in the Old Testament. The phrase
"end of the world" is found seven times. The tribulation lasts 7 years
divided into two 42 month periods (7 x 6).  I believe the millennium will
start on the seventh day of God's calendar (II Peter 3:8 But, beloved, be
not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a
thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.) The phrase "Jesus
Christ" is found 196 times (7 x 28). The phrase "word of God" is found 49
times (7 x 7) showing it is perfect and complete. His word is purified
seven times. (Psalm 12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver
tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.) The phrase "Christ
Jesus" is found seven times in Ephesians. "It is written" is found 63
times (7 x 9) in the New Testament. Word as a title for Jesus is found
seven times.

Jesus uttered seven phrases from the cross. His final was "It is
finished." The word "finished" is found 42 times. (7 x 6) The four gospels
mention the words put above Jesus while he was on the cross. Those words
added together from the four gospels equal 28 which is 7 x 4. As mentioned
earlier the number four represents the gospel as seen in the four gospels
of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

The best reference to the Godhead found in scripture is found in I
John 5:7 (I John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the
Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.). Five is
grace and seven is perfection and completeness. All is perfect and
complete in the Godhead and by the grace of God we have salvation through
Jesus. Most bible versions remove this reference to the Godhead and take
parts from verses 6 and 8 to make you think they never removed this verse.

The word "JEHOVAH" is found 7 times in scripture, four times by
itself and three times as a place name. Newer versions often omit some or
all of these references including the NKJV (New King James Version) and
NIV (New International Version) which omit all seven. They do not want you
to know the name of God. Satan controls the translators of these other
versions.

Seven types of musical instruments are mentioned in Daniel 3. Seven
officials are mentioned in Daniel 3. (princes, governors, captains,
judges, treasurers, counsellors, and sheriffs) The furnace was heated
seven times hotter than normal, but God protected the three Hebrews
showing his complete deliverance of his people. Proverbs 6:16-19 lists
seven things that are an abomination unto the LORD. Hebrews chapter seven
speaks of the perfect priesthood of Melchisedec. Hebrews mentions seven
titles or descriptions for Jesus. Hebrews 1:2 says "heir of all things",
Hebrews 2:10 "captain of their salvation", Hebrews 3:1 "Apostle" and "High
Priest", Hebrews 5:9 "author of eternal salvation", Hebrews  6:20
"forerunner", and Hebrews 12:2 "author and finisher of our faith."  Seven
Psalms written by David are mentioned in the New Testament. (Psalm 2, 16,
32, 41, 69, 95, and 109)

Jesus is the seventh word in Matthew 1:1 and Jesus is the seventh from the
last word in the last verse in scripture found in Revelation 22:21. This
is changed in many modern bibles again destroying God's pattern. It only
makes sense that the seventh word of the New Testament and the seventh to
last word in scripture is Jesus since seven is God's perfect number just
as Jesus was the only perfect man. It all starts and ends with Jesus as
all of scripture is about Jesus or to point us to him.

There are many other times the number seven is seen in scripture,
both in the actual number being used and in the number of times something
happens or is listed, or a word or phrase is found, et cetera. The false
versions change the number of times a phrase is mentioned so that the
number pattern is not found and/or make other changes such as change the
seven letter Saviour to six letters. Often even the fact of the verse
number or chapter where something is found is significant. These patterns
are also found with many other numbers and colors, even the metal that an
object is made out of. God has shown that he alone inspired and preserved
his word in the King James Bible.

The number seven is even seen in nature as created by God. There are
seven musical notes (A-G). There are seven types of light (visible, x-ray,
gamma ray, infrared, ultraviolet, radio, and microwaves.) Visible light
consists of seven colors as seen in the rainbow. (Red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, and violet) There are seven shapes of minerals in
nature: cubic or isometric, hexagonal, tetragonal, trigonal, orthorhombic,
monoclinic, and triclinic.

The gestation period of many animals is in a multiple of seven,
especially mammals and many insects. Most insects are in the ova stage
from 14 (7 x 2) to 42 (7 x 6) days. The mouse is 21 days, hare and rat is
28 days, cat is 56 days, dog is 63 days, lion is 98, sheep is 147 (7 x
21). Note Jacob lived for 147 years. People are normally 280 days ( 7 x
40). God said people normally live for threescore and ten years 70 years
(7 x 10) (Psalm 90:10). A common hen is 21 days and a duck is 42 days.

Most diseases or illnesses such as gout in people work on days of
seven or fourteen or 21 days. Every seven years our bodies replace all of
our cells. People have seven bones in their neck, fourteen bones in the
face (7 x 2), and seven holes in the skull (2 for the eyes, 2 for the
ears, 1 for the mouth, 1 for the nose, and one for the spine).

It is very clear that the number seven has a significant meaning in
scripture and to God.
