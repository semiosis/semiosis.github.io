God is Love

I have preached on God is light, but now we will see that God is
love. (I John 4:8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.) (I
John 4:16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God
is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.)
God has many attributes and he is many things. It is because God is light
that God is also love. God showed this ultimate love when he sent his only
begotten Son Jesus Christ to earth to be born as the God-man so that he
could bear the sins of the world for all time and shed his precious blood
for us as he was crucified on that cross at Calvary so that we might have
everlasting life if we choose Jesus as our Saviour. God the Father sent
his only begotten Son to die for us so that we could have the opportunity
to spend eternity with him. (John 3:16-17 16 ¶ For God so loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into
the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be
saved.) It takes a tremendous amount of love for a father to be willing to
let his only begotten son die for someone else through no fault of their
own. Most earthly fathers would not do this and especially for an enemy of
theirs yet God the Father who is love did just this when he sent his only
begotten Son Jesus to take the place on the cross for every person that
has ever lived or ever will live and bore their sins and died for them.
Jesus suffered greatly not only on the cross, but with his scourging
before going to that cross. He then suffered by bearing the world's sins.
None of us can imagine the pain that was. The worst pain of all was not
that he was rejected by the very men he created and was dying for, but
when he was rejected by God the Father who could not look upon sin, even
if it was his own Son. Jesus who knew no sin became sin for us. That is
love. (II Corinthians 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew
no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.) I said
most earthly fathers would not be willing to sacrifice their son for a
friend, let alone an enemy, yet Jesus died for his enemies. (Romans 5:8
But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us.) Jesus said no greater love hath a man than to die for
a friend yet Jesus died for his enemies, even those who were crucifying
him. (John 15:13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down
his life for his friends.) Scripture says we love God because he first
loved us. (I John 4:19 We love him, because he first loved us.) Love comes
from God. It is true that God is love, but one lady changed the King James
Bible to her own version God's Name is Love King James Bible. She replaced
LORD with Love. God is love, but he is more than that. He is also LORD and
commands us not to alter his word. If she truly loves the Lord as I
believe she thinks she does then she will leave God's word alone. Remember
we saw God is also light and God is a Spirit and he is many things so we
cannot change his word and limit who God is.    

The apostle John was called the disciple that Jesus loved and so I do
not believe that it is a coincidence that John speaks often of love in his
writings. (John 13:23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his
disciples, whom Jesus loved.) As the disciple whom Jesus loved, God showed
this great love by allowing John to be the only apostle who was not
martyred. John uses the word love a total of 62 times out of the 310 times
it is found in scripture in his five writings. John uses love 22 times in
John, 33 times in I John, four times in II John, one time in III John, and
two times in Revelation. We see significant meanings with the number of
times that the word love is found in John's writings. The number 22 in
John means light as we saw in our study God is Light. This shows the
connection between light and love as God is both light and love. It is
also in the gospel of John that we see Jesus is the light of the world
again showing you the connection. It is not a coincidence that the facts
that God is light and God is love are both found in I John. The 33 times
love is found in I John shows the promise of God to save us for those who
call upon Jesus as their Saviour. The number 33 is 3 times 11 with three
representing the Godhead. Those 33 times love is found in I John is more
than in any other book of the Holy Bible. We next see love found four
times in II John with four meaning the gospel. It is because God is love
that we have the gospel which is the death, burial, and resurrection of
his only begotten Son Jesus. Love is found one time in III John showing
the unity of not only the Godhead of one God in three persons as we saw in
God is Light, but also shows the unity that God's love brings when he
unites believers back into fellowship with him. When a person is saved
their spiritual body is united or reconnected once again with God. In
John's final book of Revelation then we see love is used twice. It is only
used in speaking about the church. Either Jesus loves the church or they
do not love him. This two in Revelation shows the union we have as
believers with Jesus and also the division that we now have with the
world. Just as we as Christians will show forth some of the light of God
since he dwells within us, then we will also show at least some of God's
love towards others even if it is only a small amount, because God who is
love lives in us. God even tells us that one of the ways to know if a
person is truly saved and one of his children is because they love one
another. (I John 4:20-21 20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his
brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath
seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? 21 And this commandment
have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.) We show
we love God by obeying God's commandments and that includes loving your
brother in Christ. (I John 5:1-3 1 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him
also that is begotten of him.

2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and
keep his commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his
commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.)

We are told twice in scripture that God is love as we saw earlier.
The first time is in I John 4:8. We saw the number four means gospel and
it is because God is love that we can be saved even when we do not deserve
it. The number eight means new beginning which everyone who is born again
gets when they receive the light of God. The second verse showing God is
love is found in I John 4:16. I just showed four is the gospel and the
number 16 means love so it is not a coincidence that the very verse that
says God is love is found in verse 16. The number 16 is 2 times 8. We saw
eight means new beginning and two new beginnings brings born again
salvation and the love for others who are born again. (I John 4:7 Beloved,
let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is
born of God, and knoweth God.) I John 4:7 also shows love comes from God.
This makes sense since God is love then only he can give love. Satan is
hate and will never bring love. I Corinthians 13 speaks of charity nine
times. Charity is a special Christian love that only a Christian can have
and it is found nine times in this chapter with nine meaning the fruit of
the Spirit. It is only because of the Spirit who as God is love and lives
within us that we can show this special love to another Christian. This
number 16 showing God's love is seen in no better verse than in John 3:16
which we read earlier. I preached on the 3:16 verses throughout scripture
and you will see that love throughout. Besides John 3:16, John also shows
in I John 3:16 how we need to follow the example of Jesus and be willing
to die for our brothers and sisters in Christ. (I John 3:16-17 16 Hereby
perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we
ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 But whoso hath this
world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels
of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?)  

We are commanded to love God with all of our heart. (Deuteronomy 6:5
And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy might.) This should not be hard for a Christian
if they truly understand the love God has for us in sending his only
begotten Son to die in our place on the cross. We can never love God back
enough for what Jesus did for us. God not only commands us to love him and
fellow Christians as we saw earlier, but also we are commanded to love our
neighbor. God did not say to love only good neighbors, but all neighbors.
(Galatians 5:14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this;
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.) It is by this love that we can
maybe win the lost to the Lord. We are commanded to love one another
because God loves us. (John 13:34 A new commandment I give unto you, That
ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.)
Jesus said if we love him then God the Father will love us. (John 14:21 He
that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and
he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and
will manifest myself to him.) Jesus said over and over to love one
another. (I John 4:10-12 10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but
that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 12 No man
hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and
his love is perfected in us.) Verse 10 shows God loved us, not that we
loved God, yet he still sent his Son to pay the penalty for our sins.
There is no greater love than that. We should thank God every day for that
love.

God has shown throughout history that he is love in the fact that he
not only keeps his promises, but also in how he has preserved Israel
despite all of her many sins and rebellion against him. Satan has tried
throughout history to destroy Israel, but God's love toward Israel even
despite her rejection of her has supernaturally protected her. God has
shown his great love in other ways as well by always protecting his
children even wayward children such as Lot from his wrath. God protected
Noah and his family on the ark from the global flood, protected Lot and
his family from the destruction he brought upon Sodom by getting them out
of the city before he destroyed it, and he will keep his children from his
wrath in the great tribulation when he raptures them home. Because God is
love, not only did he send Jesus to die for us, but he will never force
anyone to accept his Son as their Saviour. God gives every person the free
will to reject him if they so choose. God also allowed angels to reject
him of which one third did. Because he loves us he does not want puppets
that he can control, but rather someone who will love him back. God showed
he is love from the very beginning when Adam and Eve sinned then he
sacrificed an animal to make clothes for them to cover their shame and he
promised that a seed of the woman would come and redeem mankind one day to
reunite them with God. That seed of course was Jesus who will redeem
anyone who calls upon him. God shows his love everyday by delaying his
second coming not wishing that any should perish. (II Peter 3:9 The Lord
is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is
longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance.) Because God is love then he disciplines his
children just as any good dad does. (Revelation 3:19 As many as I love, I
rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.) Both God the Father
and Jesus Christ send their love by giving grace, mercy, and peace. (II
John 3 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from
the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.) God the
Father showed love to his only begotten Son in many ways including
resurrecting him from the grave so that he might be the firstfruits for
those of us who are saved. (John 3:35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath
given all things into his hand.)

God is love as we have seen, but people often forget he is also a God
of wrath. God does not like being a God of wrath, but rather a God of
love, but because he is a God of love sometimes he must bring wrath. This
is also due to his righteousness and so for those who reject his Son Jesus
then he will send them to hell. Those who go to hell have chosen hell by
rejecting Jesus as their Saviour. As a loving God, he will not make people
go to heaven and spend eternity with him so he allows them to go to hell
even though it was originally created for the devil and his angels. Heaven
would be hell for someone who hated God and rejected his love yet was
forced to spend eternity with him. God is love and he wishes that all
would call upon his Son and be saved. For those who are not saved, please
call upon Jesus today and receive the free love of God. Many people today
have no one who loves them, yet God is love and will love you with no
conditions attached as long as you call upon his Son to save you and even
if you do not he will still love you by allowing you to not spend eternity
with him. It is much better to take the free love that is offered, so call
upon Jesus now. You will never be offered any greater love than the love
of God in his Son Jesus. Remember God offers this love to everyone
regardless of their wealth, social status, gender, where they live, free
or bond, color of one's skin, how bad a person they think they are, or any
other category we make so there is no excuse not to receive this free gift
today. You will never regret receiving the love of God.
