Genealogies of Jesus

As we prepare to celebrate Christmas and the birth of Jesus as a man,
I want to look back at the genealogies of Jesus. This is not your usual
Christmas story, but my preaching is not normal. I try and bring out the
neglected things in scripture. Today people are often using DNA to try and
find out their ancestry, but in the days of Jesus genealogies were well
recorded for all to verify as who your dad was was very important in some
cases such as we will see with Jesus. At the time of the birth of Jesus
the genealogy of a person was very important to the Jews as well as many
other countries. The genealogies of the Jews were well recorded and in the
case of Jesus it was especially important because he claimed to be the son
or descendant of king David. He told his disciples that one day he would
reign as king from the throne of David. In order to do that he would have
to prove that he was eligible to do so. The genealogy of Jesus could
easily be verified as to whether his claim was legitimate. We are given
three accounts of the genealogy of Jesus in the gospels. Most people only
claim there are two accounts, but I will show you there are actually three
as to who Jesus is. The accounts vary in details and we will see that this
is important and is not an error in scripture or a contradiction.

The Jews were looking for the Messiah to come and knew that the
Messiah would be born in Bethlehem as the descendant of David or as a son
of David as they referred to him. (Jeremiah 23:5 ¶ Behold, the days come,
saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a
King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in
the earth.) (Matthew 22:42 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is
he? They say unto him, The Son of David.) A son in scripture does not
always necessarily mean a literal son, but in this case just a descendant.
(Matthew 1:1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
the son of Abraham.) To prove he was the Messiah, Jesus would have to
proof that he had fulfilled all of the prophecies concerning the Messiah
starting with the right to rule on the throne of David as his son. The
genealogy of Jesus was never doubted that he was the son of David as he
was referred to as that and the people wanted him to take the throne at
that time and overthrow the Romans. I already said they could easily go to
the temple and verify the genealogy of Jesus and the people did. The Jews
of Jesus' day never questioned why there were two different accounts of
Jesus' genealogy as they understood that both were legitimate. It was
clear that Jesus was a son of David. Here are some verses showing they
understood Jesus was a rightful heir of David's throne. Two blind men know
Jesus is the son of David. (Matthew 9:27 ¶ And when Jesus departed thence,
two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have
mercy on us.) The people knew Jesus was the son of David as he rode into
Jerusalem on Palm Sunday as they were hoping he was coming as king.
(Matthew 21:9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed,
cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in
the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.) Since the people understood
that Jesus was a legitimate son of David and rightful heir to the throne
then they wanted to make him king even if they had to force him to become
king as they wanted to remove the authority of Rome. (John 6:15 ¶ When
Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to
make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.) Jesus
will one day claim the throne of David, but that will not be until his
second coming when he will reign from Jerusalem for one thousand years
during the Millennium. Jesus came the first time, not to be king even
though he had that right, but rather to be the Saviour of mankind.

The first genealogy account that we will look at is found in Matthew
1. There are differences in opinion about these genealogies. Matthew 1
shows the genealogy of Jesus from David by his stepdad Joseph from David's
son Solomon. (Matthew 1:6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the
king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;) (Matthew 1:16
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is
called Christ.) (Matthew 1:20
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not
to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of
the Holy Ghost.) This genealogy will show Jesus is the legitimate son of
David because Joseph has taken Jesus as his adopted son and therefore he
gets all the rights of a natural son as Joseph was his legal dad. The only
problem was Jesus was disqualified from the throne since there was a king
in this line that was cursed by God who said he would never have a
descendant to reign on the throne. This is where the second genealogy
account will come into play later. The cursed king was Jeconiah who was
also known as Coniah and Jehoiachin. (Jeremiah 22:30 Thus saith the LORD,
Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for
no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and
ruling any more in Judah.) Because of this curse Jesus would be
disqualified from the throne except for his line through Mary. There are
people who claim that Jesus was still not disqualified since he was not a
blood descendant of Joseph and therefore was not a part of the curse.
Since Joseph was the legal dad of Jesus it is said that he is thus still
eligible. It is said that Jesus could claim the throne as the legal son of
Joseph because of what is known as the levirate marriage rule where if a
brother died without any children then the next brother was expected to
marry his brother's widow and give her children. This first child would be
considered as the offspring of the dead brother with any additional
children as the children of the living brother. This was done to keep the
family name alive. The first child would retain all rights of the dead
brother. (Deuteronomy 25:6 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she
beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his
name be not put out of Israel.) Others have claimed they believe that the
curse only applied to the lifetime of Jeconiah or to his son and did not
continue on. They say this can be seen in Zerubbabel who was the governor
of Judah upon the Jews return following the end of the Babylonian
captivity. It is believed that Zerubbabel was the grandson of Jeconiah as
mentioned in my Zechariah study. (I Chronicles 3:16-17 16 And the sons of
Jehoiakim: Jeconiah his son, Zedekiah his son.

17 ¶ And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,) (Haggai 1:1 In
the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day
of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son
of Josedech, the high priest, saying,) It is true that Zerubbabel was made
governor, but this is still not the same as king and there is no evidence
that his governorship was passed down to his sons and on down the line.
Others have said that Jeconiah repented during the Babylonian captivity
and thus God ended the curse. They also use the example of Zerubbabel as
governor as well as the fact that Jeconiah was elevated by the Babylonian
king to no longer be in prison, but rather to eat at the king's table. (II
Kings 25:27-30 27 ¶ And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of
the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the
seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon
in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king
of Judah out of prison;
28 And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the
kings that were with him in Babylon;
29 And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually
before him all the days of his life.
30 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a
daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.) It is possible I
suppose that any of these possibilities about Jeconiah are true and that
Jesus was still eligible for the throne by Joseph due to legal rights, but
I believe that it is most likely from Mary that Jesus obtained those
rights and that is why we have the second genealogy account in Luke.
Luke's account may have just been to show that Jesus is well qualified as
he is qualified by both his mom and stepdad, but I think it is by Mary
which is why God told Moses the rule about women by Zelophehad's daughters
which would come into play with Mary.

The second genealogy of Jesus as a man can be found in Luke 3. This
second genealogy shows Jesus as a blood descendent of David by his mom
Mary by David's son Nathan rather than Solomon by his mom Mary. This
genealogy leaves no doubt that Jesus has a rightful claim to the throne of
David which he will assume during the Millennium. (Luke 3:23 And Jesus
himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the
son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,) (Luke 3:31 Which was the son of
Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the son of Mattatha, which
was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David,) Verse 23 shows Jesus
as the supposed son of Joseph since he was only the adopted son of Joseph
and not his biological son. It says Joseph and not Mary since the man was
the head of the house, not the wife and this is how genealogies were
determined. There are some who say that Mary is not mentioned since this
genealogy still applies to Joseph rather than Mary and this is seen by his
name being mentioned. They say this genealogy shows the Levirate laws in
effect as Heli may have been the father-in-law of Joseph and was
considered the adopted son of Heli. These things may be true, but I tend
to believe that Luke's genealogy shows the bloodline of Jesus by Mary. I
believe the fact that Jesus is able to claim the throne of David by his
mom Mary is the reason that God told Moses how to handle the situation
with Zelophehad's daughters. Zelophehad had had five daughters, but no
sons. He died in the wilderness and his daughters said to Moses that they
should be entitled to their dad's property or else it would be removed
from the family because there were no sons. God agreed and told Moses that
they were to get their share of land, but that they had to marry men
within their own tribe so that the land would stay in the tribe. (Numbers
27:6-8 6 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
7 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a
possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt
cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
8 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die,
and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his
daughter.) By God allowing this exception this would then later allow
Jesus to assume the throne by a woman Mary rather than through a man. I do
believe that most likely Heli was the dad of Mary and that as I said
Joseph was the adopted son of Heli who probably had no daughters and by
adopting Joseph he could pass along the line of David by Nathan as well as
Joseph's own line by Solomon. Joseph would have been the son in law of
Heli, but he is referred to as son since this was how they believed unlike
the way we do today. Also there was no specific word in Greek for son in
law unlike in Hebrew so son would be used. Zelophehad's daughters were
required to marry within the tribe so that the land stayed in the tribe
and the same still applies here which it did. Mary and Joseph were both of
the tribe of Judah so Mary obeyed by marrying within her tribe. Some try
to say Mary was a Levite since her cousin Elisabeth was a Levite, but that
is not true. (Luke 1:5 ¶ There was in the days of Herod, the king of
Judæa, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his
wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.) Most
likely Mary's dad Heli married a Levite who was the sister of either the
mom or dad of Elisabeth and thus Elisabeth was her cousin, but they were
from different tribes. Those who claim that Mary was a Levite say this
shows how Jesus is entitled to be both king by Joseph and priest by Mary,
but Jesus gets his priesthood by God, not Mary. It was very unusual for
the genealogy to be traced by the mom rather than the dad, but then again
Jesus was not your ordinary son in having been born of a virgin. People
often claim the Bible is sexist against women as it is a patriarchal
society, yet Christianity gives more opportunities to females than any
other religion and here we see how the important genealogy of Jesus to
prove he has a right as the Messiah to the throne of David comes from a
female and not a man so this claim is false. Jesus will one day soon rule
and it will be by his bloodline through his mom and not by a man. The fact
that God allowed Zelophehad's daughters the right of inheritance and then
later continue on to other women including Mary shows God's grace and love
for women as much as men.

A third genealogy of Jesus is found in John. Most people miss this
genealogy. The two genealogies in Matthew and Luke are relevant to
Christmas as they show the birth of Jesus as a man and his earthly
connection to man as a man. This shows Jesus was a man just like any man
today and he had descendants and ancestry just like us. Jesus could
clearly trace his ancestry back to David and beyond and he had every right
to claim to be the Messiah and he will have every right to reign as King
one day soon. John does not show the genealogy of Jesus as a man, but
rather as God. Unlike the Matthew and Luke genealogies which show a
beginning for Jesus as a man, John shows that as God Jesus has always
existed. This genealogy does not show the creation of Jesus as God, but
rather that he as God has always existed and created everything else.
(John 1:1-3 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.
2 The same was in the beginning with God.
3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that
was made.) It is important to include this genealogy as Jesus was not a
mere man when he was here on earth, but rather was the God-man who became
a 100% man just like any man, yet he still retained his 100% being God.
(John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace
and truth.) (Colossians 2:9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the
Godhead bodily.) It is by the fact that Jesus as God was willing to become
a man and die for our sins and rise again from the grave on that third day
that we are able to be reconciled with God.

There are two genealogies listed for Jesus as a man to clearly show
that Jesus is the son of David which was never disputed and he does have
the legal right to reign as king. This was also never disputed. We also
see a third genealogy in John showing how Jesus has always been God and
only became a man when he was born in a virgin birth by Mary. As we will
soon celebrate Christmas, remember how Jesus will one day reign as king
and remember his genealogical record bears proof that he is the Messiah
and son of David. Remember that there are no contradictions or errors
found in the King James Bible and we see again this is true with two
completely different genealogies of the same person. All things are in
scripture for a reason, even the seemingly unimportant things such as
Zelophehad's daughters. This also shows how all scripture is about Jesus.
We need to just study scripture and learn from it so that we may
understand the coming future events. Praise God that he allowed
Zelophehad's daughters the right to an inheritance so that Jesus was
allowed his rightful inheritance because of this law by his mom Mary. God
truly is a righteous and loving God.
