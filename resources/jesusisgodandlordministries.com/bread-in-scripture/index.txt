Bread in Scripture

Bread is seen throughout scripture with various meanings. The most
important is that Jesus is the bread of life. Various examples as seen in
scripture were a type of Jesus as the bread of life.

Bread is a staple throughout the world. Bread is one of those foods
that provide enough nutrition that you can survive on it along with water
for days. (Some say in theory for three weeks or up to six months, though
you would have health problems.) It was common to feed prisoners only
bread and water. When people have a meal together, it is often said "let
us break bread" meaning let us eat or have a meal together. A great hymn
telling of the bread of life of Jesus is "Break Thou the Bread of Life".
Bread was seen in the temple as well as the home. We see bread and water
given to Hagar and Ishmael. This was not only for their physical survival,
but was a type and symbolic of Jesus as the bread of life and the living
water. Abraham gave her the two things she needed for life. (Genesis 21:14
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of
water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child,
and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of
Beer-sheba.)

We see in Egypt where the people were spiritually dead, they had a
famine and no bread. They had a real physical famine and no bread for
their physical bodies, but they also had a spiritual famine in their
hearts and souls and spiritual bodies as they had rejected the bread of
life of Jesus. There was no bread without Jesus. (Genesis 47:30 ¶ And
there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that
the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the
famine.) Egypt will end their spiritual famine one day and receive that
bread. (Isaiah 19:19-21)

You all remember the story of Lot being captured in Sodom by kings
fighting the king of Sodom. After Abraham and his men helped rescue Lot
after the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings with him, Melchizedek
brought him bread and wine. (Genesis 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem
brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.)
(Hebrews 7:1-3 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most
high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and
blessed him;
2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem,
which is, King of peace;
3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither
beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God;
abideth a priest continually.) I believe Melchizedek was the pre-incarnate
Jesus. He is best described in Hebrews chapter 7. I believe the giving of
the bread and wine was Melchizedek (Jesus) showing that you only need the
bread and blood of Jesus for eternal life. I also believe it was a type of
the future command of Jesus to celebrate communion or the Lord's Supper of
which it represented.

We see the bread of life represented in communion or the Lord's
Supper. The bread was his flesh that he told the people they needed to eat
of him, not his literal body. Jesus celebrated communion the first time
with his apostles the night before he died in the upper room in Jerusalem
during his passover meal. It was at this time that he told his disciples
that the bread that he broke was given to them and in remembrance of him.
(Luke 22:19-20 ¶ And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and
gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in
remembrance of me. 20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup
is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.) The bread
represented his body that would be broken on the cross for all of mankind
and we are to celebrate communion to remember what Jesus did for us on the
cross at Calvary. (I Corinthians 10:16-17 The cup of blessing which we
bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we
break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers
of that one bread.) We as Christians are all one body and all partake of
the same Jesus. Paul explains more about communion in (I Corinthians
11:23-30 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took
bread:
24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is
my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying,
This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink
it, in remembrance of me.
26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the
Lord's death till he come.
27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the
Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and
drink of that cup.
29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.)
Christians are not to partake of communion lightly. It is a serious solemn
occasion as we celebrate and remember the Lord's death for us until he
comes back again for us. (I Corinthians 10:21 Ye cannot drink the cup of
the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's
table, and of the table of devils.) I believe we should use unleavened
bread in our partaking of communion as representative of the sinless body
of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour.

We see the Jews celebrated the feast of unleavened bread which
remembered the Hebrews quick departure from Egypt after the ten plaques.
The Hebrews did not have time to let their bread rise and therefore it had
no leaven (yeast) (leaven represents sin). During the feast of unleavened
bread, the Jews are to cleanse their house of all leaven which is symbolic
of removing sin. The bread could not have leaven since it represents Jesus
and Jesus was sinless. (II Corinthians 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin
for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in
him.) (I Peter 2:22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:)
The first day of this feast is passover, where Jesus became our passover
lamb. (I Corinthians 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may
be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is
sacrificed for us:) This was one of the three mandatory feasts required by
God for all Jewish males to come to the temple and make a sacrifice, the
others being Pentecost and the feast of tabernacles.  

The shewbread in the tabernacle and temple was another type of Jesus.
This was to be placed fresh every sabbath on the table of shewbread and
was to be done always. (I Chronicles 9:32 And other of their brethren, of
the sons of the Kohathites, were over the shewbread, to prepare it every
sabbath.) One needs to worship Jesus weekly. He should never become stale
in our lives. (Exodus 25:30 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread
before me alway.) II Chronicles 2;4 tells us it is to be a continual
showbread. We are to never forget Jesus and his sacrifice for us. (Numbers
4:7 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and
put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover
withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:) Notice that the table
of shewbread was covered with a blue cloth, with blue again showing
separation and how with Jesus we are to be set apart from the world. We
remember the story of when David and his men ate the shewbread because
they were hungry. It was intended only for the priests, but David knew he
needed to not only satisfy his physical hunger, but only Jesus represented
by the shewbread could satisfy his spiritual hunger. David knew where he
needed to go to satisfy his hunger. We need to as well.

The miracles of the feeding of the 5,000 and the 4,000 shows not only
Jesus is God, but that bread represented Jesus. Jesus can take a little
and feed all those who hunger for him. In the feeding of the 5,000, Jesus
took five loaves and fed many. In the feeding of the 4,000, Jesus took
seven loaves and fed 4,000. (Matthew 14:19-21 And he commanded the
multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two
fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the
loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
21 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and
children.) (Matthew 15:33-38 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should
we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
34 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said,
Seven, and a few little fishes.
35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake
them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken
meat that was left seven baskets full.
38 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
children.) Notice that Jesus actually fed more than the 5,000 and 4,000 as
the women and children were not counted, so there was probably as least
double the number in each instance. Also note that Jesus blessed the food
and gave thanks for it before distributing it. Let this be a lesson and
example for us to always ask God to bless our food and give thanks for it
before we eat. Jesus also broke the bread into pieces representing his
future brokenness on the cross for our sins. In both feedings, they were
in a desert place. Jesus will not only feed us in a desert, but if our
spiritual life is a desert, he will feed those who seek him and hunger for
him and ask to be fed.

The manna that the people ate daily in the wilderness for forty
years, is a type of Jesus. (Exodus 16:35 And the children of Israel did
eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat
manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.) This was
food given to the people from heaven. (Exodus 16:15 And when the children
of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not
what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD
hath given you to eat.) Manna is what angels eat. (Psalm 78:25 Man did eat
angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.) Just as the manna came from
heaven, Jesus also came from heaven to feed us. Unlike with the manna,
where the people ate of it and still died, when one eats of the bread of
life of Jesus, they will never die. (John 6:31 Our fathers did eat manna
in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.)
(John 6:58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall
live for ever.) Manna as a type of Jesus was one of three things along
with the ten commandments and Aaron's budding rod that was placed in the
ark of the covenant. (Hebrews 9:4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark
of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot
that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the
covenant;) Manna as seen above was intended to be food for angels given to
them by Jesus and they too have eternal life.

In Jesus's sermon on the mount in Matthew chapter 6, Jesus teaches
the people how to pray. This prayer is often called the Lord's Prayer, but
I believe the pray of Jesus seen in all of John chapter 17 when he prayed
for himself, the apostles, and all future Christians should better be
referred to as the Lord's Prayer. In the Lord 's Prayer in Matthew, Jesus
mentions pray for God to give us our daily bread. This is more than for
the physical bread we need to eat to survive everyday, we also need the
bread of life of Jesus daily in our lives. We should pray to God everyday
and read the word of God daily. (Mathew 6:11 Give us this day our daily
bread.) Jesus was telling the people to pray for him in their lives.

Paul gave thanks and broke bread and ate it after his ship was
wrecked while he was a prisoner being taken to Rome. (Acts 27:35) Paul
broke the bread symbolic of communion. Paul knew he needed bread for this
life and his spiritual life.

Satan always tries to take what Jesus gives us and make it evil.
Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness by trying to get him to turn the
stones into bread to satisfy his physical hunger. Satan tried to entice
Jesus with the lust of the flesh. We need to always reject what Satan has
to offer. It will only bring temporary satisfaction, but will always bring
death. (See Hebrews 11:25) (Matthew 4:2-4 And when he had fasted forty
days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.
3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God,
command that these stones be made bread.
4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.) When
tempted of Satan, use the example of Jesus and quote scripture back to
him. The devil will flee. One irony in this tempting of Jesus is that even
Satan knows Jesus can and does bring forth life and always will. Jesus
warned his disciples and us not to partake of the bread of the Pharisees
and Sadducees. (Matthew 16:12 Then understood they how that he bade them
not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees
and of the Sadducees.) The Pharisees represented sin and tradition as do
the false teachers of today. Satan always presents the false doctrine and
offers the false bread. The bread of Satan always leads to eternal death.

Jesus is the bread of life that we all need. Without it, one cannot
have eternal life. Jesus told the people he was the bread from heaven and
with his bread, one would never hunger again unlike the manna he was
compared to. (John 6:35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life:
he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall
never thirst.) (John 6:48 I am that bread of life.) (John 6:51 I am the
living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he
shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I
will give for the life of the world.) Jesus is all we need to supply both
our spiritual thirst and our spiritual hunger. He is there for those who
hunger and thirst for righteousness. Jesus is the bread of life and living
water people hunger and thirst for. (Mathew 5:6 Blessed are they which do
hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.)

Jesus was born in Bethlehem Ephratah in Judaea (Micah 5:2 But thou,
Beth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah,
yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel;
whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.) (Matthew 2:1
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the
king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,). Bethlehem
means "House of Bread." Jesus is the bread of life. (John 6:35 And Jesus
said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never
hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.) (John 6:51 I am
the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this
bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh,
which I will give for the life of the world.) It is no coincidence that
Jesus as the bread of life would be born in the house of bread in order to
satisfy our spiritual hunger. Just as physical bread satisfies us and
gives us physical energy, Jesus as the bread of life satisfies, gratifies,
and strengthens us spiritually. Jesus is the only bread we need for
spiritual life and spiritual satisfaction. Jesus was born in the house of
bread and died during the feast of unleavened bread (bread without leaven
[sin]).

Just as we need the living water of Jesus for spiritual eternal life,
we also need the bread of life of Jesus for eternal life. Let us be like
the people who searched and followed him to the other side of the sea at
Capernaum after the miracles of the feeding of the 5,000 and Jesus walking
on the water when they said (John 6:34 Then said they unto him, Lord,
evermore give us this bread.) Let us not be like them after Jesus told
them he was that bread and to eat of it, when they walked no more with
him. (John 6:66 ¶ From that time many of his disciples went back, and
walked no more with him.) Let us believe and have eternal life.
