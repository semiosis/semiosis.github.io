The Illegal Trial of Jesus

This is based off a book by the lawyer Earle L. Wingo. The Sanhedrin
was the court of the Jews. Its authority was supreme in all matters -
civil, criminal, political, social and religious. It was led by the high
priest and consisted of 70 members. Most of the members including the high
priest were Sadducees (Acts 5:17 ¶ Then the high priest rose up, and all
they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were
filled with indignation,), who did not believe in a resurrection. (Luke
20:27 ¶ Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there
is any resurrection; and they asked him,) The Sanhedrin was already
prejudiced against Jesus having already desired to have planned his death
because Jesus pointed out their hypocrisies and sins. They wanted to keep
their power and control over the people. Many laws were broken in order to
execute Jesus and the Jewish leaders allowed the mob to take over.  

The charge brought against the defendant, before the court of the
Sanhedrin, was

"blasphemy against Jehovah."

The criminal indictment brought against the defendant before Pilate and
Herod, was

"treason against the government of Rome." Jesus said he was a King.

This trial took place in less than twelve hours. Jesus was taken at
night and crucified at the third hour (9 am.). (Mark 15:25 And it was the
third hour, and they crucified him.) In one sense Jesus had six trials-3
Jewish (were religious) (all with guilty verdict) (Annas- gave the ok to
arrest Jesus, Caiaphas- charge of Blasphemy against Jesus and death
sentence, and the trial of the Sanhedrin-also death sentence)and three
Roman (civil) (all innocent) (Pilate, Herod, Pilate)

Broken Law 1: The arrest of Jesus was illegal. Caiaphas, the high priest
had already decided on his own to condemn Jesus to death to protect
himself and the other chief priests and he thought the nation. (John 11:50
Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the
people, and that the whole nation perish not.) (John 18:14 Now Caiaphas
was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man
should die for the people.) Caiaphas said it was expedient that one man
should die for the people. There was no warrant for his arrest. Even Saul
(Paul) needed to get letters (authority and commission) from the high
priest to go after Christians and arrest them. (Acts 9:1-2 And Saul, yet
breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the
Lord, went unto the high priest,
2 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he
found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them
bound unto Jerusalem.) (Acts 26:12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with
authority and commission from the chief priests,) Jesus was never charged
with any crime.

Broken Law 2: The Jewish law prohibited any part of legal proceedings by
night.

"A capital offense must be tried during the day and suspended at night"
(From the Mishna-A Jewish book on oral traditions and laws.  They were
carrying lanterns when they came to arrest Jesus. (John 18:3 Judas then,
having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and
Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.) Jesus
was first taken to Annas's house at night after his arrest. Annas had no
authority as high priest as he had been deposed by the Romans and Caiaphas
was the high priest. Annas sent Jesus bound to Caiaphas. Both had tried
Jesus alone which was against Jewish law. "Be not a sole judge, for there
is no sole judge but One." (Mishna)

"An accused man must never be subjected to private or secret examination,
let in his perplexity, he furnish damaging testimony against himself."



Broken Law 3: Annas had no jurisdiction. Annas was the father in law of
Caiaphas (John 18:13 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in
law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.). He was
deposed by the Romans. It is likely that Caiaphas was then chosen by the
Romans to be high priest, though God said the high priest was for life,
(Exodus 29:9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons,
and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a
perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.) so it
should have been Annas, who may have been recognized by the Jews as such.
Caiaphas probably should not have had any authority, but did by Roman
authority. Throughout the old testament we see how Aaron was high priest
until his death and then his son until his death and his son and so on as
God commanded.

Broken Law 4: Sanhedrin's unlawful assembly. The Sanhedrin was not allowed
by Jewish law to hold a death penalty case on the day before the Sabbath
(Mark 15:42 ¶ And now when the even was come, because it was the
preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,) or a feast such as the
Passover, nor during the night. Jesus was crucified on the Passover. He is
our Passover Lamb. (I Corinthians 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven,
that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our
passover is sacrificed for us:) The Jewish day starts at sunset. Also the
whole Sanhedrin was not assembled, only the people that Caiaphas knew
would back him up. Only 23 members of the Sanhedrin were needed for a
quorum. (Mark 15:1 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound
Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.) Nicodemus and
Joseph of Arimathaea, whose tomb Jesus was buried in, were not present for
the trial of Jesus. (Mark 15:43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable
counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in
boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.) (Luke 23:50-51 ¶ And,
behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man,
and a just:
51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of
Arimathæa, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of
God.)

Broken Law 5: Changing the False Accusations against Jesus. Matthew
26:60-61 says "-At the last came two false witnesses, And said, This
fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in
three days. (Matthew 26:60-61 But found none: yea, though many false
witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
61 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and
to build it in three days.) This is not what Jesus said. Jesus said in
John 2:19 Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. (John
2:19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three
days I will raise it up.) These false witnesses were twisting Jesus's
words and trying to accuse him of destroying Herod's temple, but John 2:21
shows Jesus was referring to the temple of his body. (John 2:21 But he
spake of the temple of his body.) When the accusations of these false
witnesses did not work (Mark 14:59 But neither so did their witness agree
together.), Caiaphas changed tactics and the charge by asking Jesus if he
"be the Christ, the Son of God" in Matthew 26:63. (Matthew 26:63 But Jesus
held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure
thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the
Son of God.) Jesus responded in Matthew 26:64 "Thou hast said:
nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting
on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven." (Matthew
26:64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you,
Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power,
and coming in the clouds of heaven.) In Mark 14:62, Jesus admitted to
being the Messiah or Christ. (Mark 14:62 And Jesus said, I am: and ye
shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in
the clouds of heaven.) The high priest then accused Jesus of blasphemy,
another false charge since Jesus is God. According to the Talmud (the
Jewish book of civil and ceremonial law, of which the Mishna is a part),
one is only guilty of blasphemy if they say the whole divine name of God
(Jehovah). Jesus said "I am" which is not the same name. He was sentenced
to death, which was forbidden by the Romans for the Jews to impose a death
sentence. Following the Sanhedrin's ruling of death, the Jews then brought
Jesus before Pilate so they could get authorization for the death penalty.
The Jews changed the charge against Jesus again since the Romans did not
care if someone claimed to be God as they had many gods and that was the
Jews problem. The Jews accused Jesus of planning to overthrow Caesar and
make himself King of the Jews (Luke 23:2 And they began to accuse him,
saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give
tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.). Jesus never
said he was going to be King at this time. Jesus told Pilate that his
kingdom was not of this world. (John 18:36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is
not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my
servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my
kingdom not from hence.) (The Jews said they had no king but Caesar. (John
19:15 But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.
Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests
answered, We have no king but Cæsar.) Pilate found Jesus not guilty and
sent him to Herod since Jesus was from his Jurisdiction of Galilee. Herod
also found him not guilty and sent him back to Pilate who found Jesus not
guilty again and said he washed his blood of Jesus (Matthew 27:24 ¶ When
Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was
made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I
am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.) after the
Jews called for the release of Barabbas a robber, murderer and one guilty
of sedition (insurrection against the government). (John 18:40 Then cried
they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a
robber.) and [Luke 23:18-19 18 And they cried out all at once, saying,
Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:
19 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast
into prison.)] The Jews called for the release of a guilty man and the
murder of an innocent man. (Matthew 27:20-22 But the chief priests and
elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy
Jesus.
21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye
that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.
22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called
Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.)

Broken Law 6: Jesus was not allowed any witnesses. None of the apostles
(John 15:27 And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me
from the beginning.) or any of his other disciples such as Lazarus or his
sisters Mary and Martha, who could easily testify of his deity as could
all those who he performed miracles on. Peter, James and John could
testify that God the Father said Jesus was his Son at the transfiguration.
(Matthew 17:5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed
them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.) (Mark 9:7 And there was a
cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying,
This is my beloved Son: hear him.) The Sanhedrin knew full well that Jesus
was more than a prophet by the miracles he did, but refused to admit it.

Broken Law 7: Jesus was convicted on his own statement. After Caiaphas
accused Jesus of blasphemy, no witnesses from either side were called.
Jesus was sentenced to death by his own statement. This was against Jewish
law. Jewish law said "We have it as a fundamental principle of our
jurisprudence that no one can bring an accusation against himself.
Moreover a voluntary confession on his part is not admitted in evidence."

Broken Law 8: Failed to have required two witnesses. Jewish law required
at least two male witnesses who had observed the entire crime. No
circumstantial or partial witness to crime was allowed. They did not even
have one witness against Jesus.

Broken Law 9: Death trial cannot end in one day. It is estimated that the
trials of Jesus (Jewish and Roman) lasted around seven hours from around
1-2 am to the break of dawn or at most 9 am when Jesus was crucified. That
is all in one day. Normally the Sanhedrin would have gone home at night to
pray that they make the right decision about the life of a person and
return the next day.

Broken Law 10: Sanhedrin could not authorize the death penalty. The Romans
had removed the authority of the Jews to execute people. This is why Jesus
had to be brought before Pilate. (John 18:31 Then said Pilate unto them,
Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said
unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:)

Broken Law 11: Death sentence cannot be unanimous. (Mark 14:63-64 Then the
high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further
witnesses?
64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him
to be guilty of death.) They all found him guilty. This would not have
happened if Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea had been present.  There
were no lawyers for the accused then and the judges were to act as such to
prevent mob violence. This was not the case with Jesus. The Sanhedrin did
the opposite and actually stirred up and incited the crowd to find Jesus
guilty and to be crucified.

Broken law 12: Sanhedrin members were disqualified. The "judges could not
be an enemy of the accused." This was to prevent any bias and dishonesty.
It is obvious that Jesus was despised. (John 18:14) Mark 14:1 says they
would take him by craft and put him to death. (Mark 14:1 After two days
was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief
priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put
him to death.) They also got false witnesses against Jesus. (Mark 14:57
And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,) The
judge could not serve if he was "related to the accuser." Caiphas (the
judge) was the son in law of Annas (the accuser). (John 18:13) Both found
Jesus guilty and had conspired days earlier to kill Jesus. (John 11:57 Now
both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if
any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.)
and (John 12:10-11 ¶ But the chief priests consulted that they might put
Lazarus also to death;
11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed
on Jesus.) History also says 5 of Annas's sons had been high priests and
were also present at the trial.

Broken Law 13: Jesus's defense was ignored. The members of the Sanhedrin
knew all of the Hebrew laws well. They were to "weigh the evidence in the
sincerity of their conscience." When they accused Jesus of blasphemy, they
denied the evidence that Jesus was God and ignored their own laws on
blasphemy and apparently had no conscience. It was not Jesus's job to
establish his own guilt, it was the job of the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin
had never charged Jesus with a crime before the start of the trial. It is
also possible that the Sanhedrin held the trial in an illegal place. The
Sanhedrin could only hold trials in the Hall of Hewn Stones.

Those responsible for the illegal trials of Jesus reaped the
consequences they had sewn. They had committed the greatest crime in
history by crucifying God. Judas Iscariot hanged himself. Annas was buried
in an unmarked grave, Caiaphas lived with having killed God. Caesar had
the coward Pilate executed after learning of the crucifixion of Jesus.
Herod would live to regret his actions. The Sanhedrin was dissolved soon
after the "trial" of Jesus in disgrace. The Pharisees and Sadducees no
longer exist and the Roman soldiers were forgotten. All are now in hell.

As Joseph said to his brothers in Genesis 50:20 (Genesis 50:20 But as
for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring
to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.) that what they did
to him they meant as evil, but God meant it for good, Satan and those who
crucified Jesus (especially the Jewish leaders) meant Jesus' death on the
cross for evil with Satan winning, but God meant it for good. For without
the death of Jesus on the cross and the shedding of his blood, all of
mankind would still be dead in their sins and along with the victorious
resurrection we can have eternal life to those who believe in Jesus and
Satan and his angels were defeated. (I Corinthians 15:17 And if Christ be
not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.) (Hebrews 9:22
And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without
shedding of blood is no remission.)

There is one more trial of Jesus. All people including me and you have put
Jesus on trial whether he is God in the flesh who shed his blood and died
for our sins, was buried and rose again on the third day and is at the
right hand of God. Do we find Jesus innocent of these charges that he is
who he says he is or guilty. The verdict we make will determine whether we
spend eternity in heaven or hell. Find Jesus innocent as he is innocent of
all charges and choose life. Choose Jesus is who he says he is and choose
heaven.

Jesus" by Earle L. Wingo (a lawyer). This book is available at chick.com.]
