The Exodus   

Many people claim the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt is a myth
or they minimize it in some way such as saying the Israelites crossed the
Reed sea and not the Red sea. The whole event is changed to cast doubt on
the existence of God. One reason that people want to do this is because we
see in the story how God punishes evil especially to those who mess with
the Israelites who are God's chosen people as well as how he protects his
chosen people. This also applies to true Christians that make up the
church as well that he will protect us. Sinners do not want to believe the
exodus or this means that God is real and he will then punish them for
their sins as well.

The Israelites moved to Egypt when Jacob moved his family to Egypt
during the seven years of famine that hit all of the land and only Egypt
had food with his son Joseph second in charge only to pharaoh in Egypt.
Over time the Israelites were made slaves to the Egyptians who feared that
their great population growth might cause the people to rebel and conquer
Egypt. God sent Moses back to Egypt after wondering in the wilderness for
40 years having escaped Egypt for killing a man. God told Moses to tell
pharaoh to let his people go. God told Moses that pharaoh would not listen
so God brought ten plagues against Egypt. You can see my sermon on the ten
plagues. Following the tenth plague which was the death of the firstborn
including the death of pharaoh's son then he finally let the Israelites
go. This is known as the exodus and is described in detail in the book of
Exodus. God had told the Israelites to be ready to leave at a moment's
notice which they did after midnight. After the Israelites made their
departure in the night, pharaoh changed his mind about letting them go and
he took his army and followed after them in chariots. (Exodus 14:9 But the
Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and
his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside
Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.) Verse 7 says pharaoh had 600 chariots.

Pharaoh and his army cornered the Israelites by the Red sea and the
people complained, but God used Moses to dry up the Red sea so that the
Israelites could cross over on dry ground. The Egyptians followed them,
but God brought the wall of water back upon them and drown them all,
having preserved all of the Israelites. (Exodus 14:21-30 21 And Moses
stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to
go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land,
and the waters were divided.
22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the
dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and
on their left.

23 ¶ And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the
sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the
host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and
troubled the host of the Egyptians,
25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so
that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the
LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

26 ¶ And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea,
that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots,
and upon their horsemen.
27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned
to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against
it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them;
there remained not so much as one of them.
29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the
sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on
their left.
30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians;
and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.) This verse clearly
shows that the Israelites crossed the Red sea, not the Reed sea and that
there was a wall of water around them on both sides. Doubters that say
they crossed over on the Reed sea which is not even a real sea just deny
God's word. The Reed sea is shallow enough that a person could walk across
it and narrow enough that it would not take all night to cross. You cannot
have a wall of water around you on both sides if the water is not even
over your head. It would also be highly unlikely for everyone to drown in
such shallow water and all chariots destroyed. If people would just trust
the King James Bible they would know the proper translation is the Red
sea. This was clearly a miracle by God. It would be no miracle to cross
over a body of water that is at most knee deep. Some modern bibles change
Red sea to Sea of Reeds such as the New Jerusalem Bible to deny this
miracle of God. These verses say that the chariot wheels fell off. Ron
Wyatt found the location where the Israelites crossed over. It was
actually the Gulf of Aqaba which is one of the arms of the Red sea. It was
at Nuweiba Beach that they crossed over. This was a large flat beach that
could hold the roughly two million Israelites before they crossed the Red
sea. It covers over ten square miles. It is surrounded by mountains with
only one narrow passage in just as scripture says. Scripture says they
were shut in. (Exodus 14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel,
They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.) This
location also has a land bridge under the water that would have been used
for the Israelites to cross over on after the water was removed by God and
has a shallow pitch to allow easy access to the water. At this point the
water is about 900 feet deep which would clearly make a wall of water on
both sides, but this is shallow compared to over five thousand feet on
either side of this land bridge. It is about a mile wide allowing for the
large mass of people to quickly cross. Isaiah 51:10 describes the waters
were they crossed as waters of the great deep and speaks of the depths of
the sea. This clearly again shows this was not some shallow water. The
ransomed in this verse is the Israelites and is a type of how Christians
in baptism become symbolic new creatures as they come up out of the water
and pass over to a new life with Jesus Christ. (Isaiah 51:10 Art thou not
it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made
the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?) Notice verse
22 says they crossed on the dry ground. God not only removed the water,
but also the mud that would be left after the water is removed. If you
drain a pond it will still be all muddy yet God even took care of that so
it was dry ground to cross over on. Ron Wyatt found chariot wheels at the
bottom of the sea just as scripture says God took off the chariot wheels
and they match the chariot wheels of the time period used by Egypt in the
number of spokes. If this was not the spot then how did Egyptian chariot
wheels get here? What is believed to be an ancient Egyptian fort was found
at the northern end of the beach. This would have forced the Israelites to
flee south yet the mountains here go right up to the sea leaving the
Israelites with nowhere to go except to trust in God. This is the location
in the water where the chariot wheels were found. Chariot wheels have
never been found anywhere else in the Red sea.  

Ron Wyatt also found that king Solomon had marked the sight of the
Red sea crossing into what is now Saudi Arabia with two pillars with
inscription describing the crossing. One was on the Egyptian side and one
in Saudi Arabia on the other side. The Saudi side pillar has since been
taken down by the Saudi government.    

The Israelites lived in the land of Goshen at the top of Egypt in the
area around the Nile delta which is why it was the best land in Egypt.
(Genesis 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land
make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them
dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them
rulers over my cattle.) God said he did not allow them to go straight from
there to the Promised Land, but rather detoured them south to cross the
Red sea since they were weak in the faith and were not ready to fight the
giants yet and would run back to Egypt. (Exodus 13:17-18 17 ¶ And it came
to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them
not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although
that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they
see war, and they return to Egypt:
18 But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the
Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of
Egypt.) The fact they lived in Goshen shows they did not cross at the
bottom of the Red sea and they also did not cross north of it in the
alleged Reed sea since God did not let them take the shortest route, but
purposely made them have to cross the Red sea to learn to trust in God and
not in themselves. We need to do the same. (Hebrews 11:29 By faith they
passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to
do were drowned.)   

The Israelites started leaving Egypt on 14 Nisan which became the
first passover and traveled three days journey into the wilderness and
crossed the Red sea on 17 Nisan. (Exodus 5:3 And they said, The God of the
Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey
into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us
with pestilence, or with the sword.) This is the same day that Jesus
Christ later rose from the grave. The crossing of the Red sea was a type
of the resurrection of Jesus as the Israelites were given a new life under
God. They also crossed under the water of the Red sea which like the
Genesis flood is a type of the future baptism by Christians with the
coming up out of the water in baptism representing resurrection. (I Peter
3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the
putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:) Baptism does
not save, the resurrection of Jesus does. (I Corinthians 10:1-2 1
Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all
our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;) Verse 2
seems to also imply being under the cloud was also a type of baptism with
this cloud being Jesus and clouds being made of rain water and Jesus is
the living water. (John 4:10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou
knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to
drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee
living water.) (John 7:38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath
said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.) I Corinthians
10:11 says these things were for ensamples of things to come to show you
that the crossing of the Red sea was a type of baptism. (I Corinthians
10:11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are
written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.)
Seventeen means victory and God gave the Israelites victory over the
Egyptians on this day as God drowned all of the Egyptians.   

Ron Wyatt also found other things that confirmed the events after the
crossing of the Red sea as the Israelites would wander in the wilderness
for 40 years before God allowed them to enter the Promised Land. Ron found
the mountain that is the real Mt. Sinai where Moses received the ten
commandments. The top of this mountain was blackened just as scripture
says when God spoke from it. (Exodus 19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether
on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke
thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked
greatly.) Many people claim that Mt. Sinai is in Egypt in the Sinai
Peninsula for which it was named. This cannot be as where they crossed
over shows they ended up in Saudi Arabia and even scripture says that is
where they ended up as it says in Arabia. (Galatians 4:25 For this Agar is
mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in
bondage with her children.)

Ron also found the rock that Moses struck to give the people water
while in the wilderness. The rock is about 60 feet high and split down the
middle and shows evidence of massive water erosion such as would occur
after the water would be flowing out like a river to provide water for
over two million people and their animals. (Exodus 12:37 ¶ And the
children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred
thousand on foot that were men, beside children.) This verse does not
include the women or children in the 600,000. This rock is elevated to
allow the water to flow out and down across the wilderness just like a
river. (Exodus 17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock
in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of
it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders
of Israel.)

Ron also found where Aaron made the golden calf. There is even a
drawing of the calf on the altar. (Exodus 32:8 They have turned aside
quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a
molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and
said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the
land of Egypt.) There is also a grave site about four miles from where the
golden altar was which most likely contains the 3,000 people killed by God
because of the golden calf and idolatry and also possibly the twenty
thousand killed by God in the plague associated with this event. It is
clearly a pre Muslim cemetery. This site is fenced off and guarded by the
Saudi government. (Exodus 32:28 And the children of Levi did according to
the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three
thousand men.) Scripture says that Moses ground the golden calf and
stirred it in the water and made the people drink of it showing there had
to be a stream nearby that the people drank from. Aerial evidence in the
location of where the golden calf was shows that at one time a large
stream of water did flow in this location just as scripture says. (Exodus
32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire,
and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the
children of Israel drink of it.)

We are told in Exodus 24:4 that Moses built an altar for the people
to offer sacrifices to God as well as built twelve pillars for the twelve
tribes of Israel. (Exodus 24:4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD,
and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and
twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.) It is believed
that this location has been found as well. It is impossible for all of
these things to match up with scripture if they were not the real
locations including starting with the crossing of the Red sea not the
non-existent Reed sea. Trust scripture, not man. For more information and
pictures showing the evidence you can go to Ron Wyatt's website
www.ronwyatt.com or www.doubtingthomasresearch.com which has a great
YouTube video showing evidence and Ron Wyatt has his own videos.
