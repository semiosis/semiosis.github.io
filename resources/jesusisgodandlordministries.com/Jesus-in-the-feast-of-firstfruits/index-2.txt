Jesus in the feast of firstfruits

Jesus can be found in the Jewish feast of firstfruits just as he can
in all Jewish feasts. The feast of firstfruits is one of the seven
authorized feasts that God ordered the Israelites to observe. It is the
third spring feast and occurs in the Jewish month of Nisan around March or
April of our calendar. The feast of firstfruits was always on the day
after the sabbath following passover. It would be on a Sunday or the first
day of the week. The feast of firstfruits occurs during the feast of
unleavened bread which is the seven day feast that starts the day after
passover. The Israelites were to offer an offering on the first day of the
feast of unleavened bread. The offering of the firstfruits of their barley
harvest was used for this occasion. The Israelites were to gather an omer
of barley which is roughly four dry quarts and place it into a sheaf
[bundle tied together]. Barley was the spring harvest. They were to bring
this to the priest at the court of the temple or before this to the
tabernacle. The priest then winnowed (blew air through the grain to remove
the chaff [husks], parched (dried with heat), and bruised the barley
grain. This was on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread. The
next day the priest put some incense on the sheaf and then waved it before
the LORD and then he threw some of the grain into the fire on the altar
for an offering to the LORD. The LORD would accept this meat offering and
then bless the rest of the harvest. The Israelites could not eat any of
the barley before offering the firstfruits of the barley to the LORD. The
day the sheaves were waived was the second day of the feast of unleavened
bread and also the feast of first fruits. (Leviticus 23:4-14 ¶
These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall
proclaim in their seasons.
5 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD'S passover.
6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened
bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no
servile work therein.
8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in
the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile
work therein.

9 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come
into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof,
then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the
priest:
11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on
the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without
blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.
13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour
mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet
savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the
fourth part of an hin.
14 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until
the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your
God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all
your dwellings.) The feast of firstfruits as verse 14 shows was to be
observed forever by the Israelites, but after the destruction of the
temple in AD 70, it was no longer observed. Barley was always the grain of
the poor with wheat being for the rich. I believe the significance of the
barley shows Jesus not only came as a poor man, but for all people
including the poor to bring everlasting life to them and make all people
rich through him.

The Israelites did not observe the feast of firstfruits until they
had entered the Promised Land as verse 10 shows. It was not celebrated in
the wilderness. The Israelites had to be in the Promised Land to grow the
crops as they previously wandered around. This was also done to represent
how the Jews struggled in the wilderness as they wandered in sin and how
in the Promised Land they had rest just as a person only has rest in Jesus
after they are saved. The wilderness represented bondage to sin whereas
the Promised Land represented the life a Christian has in Jesus after his
resurrection. Just as the Israelites could not eat any of the barley prior
to the offering of the firstfruits, neither could a person fully partake
of their salvation until after the resurrection of Jesus as the
firstfruits. The old testament saints did not have the Holy Ghost living
full time in them.

Jesus died on passover as our passover lamb and then he rose from the
grave on Sunday which was the feast of firstfruits to become the
firstfruits of resurrection. (I Corinthians 5:7 Purge out therefore the
old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even
Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:) (I Corinthians 15:20-23 But now
is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that
slept.
21For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the
dead.
22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they
that are Christ's at his coming.) Jesus had to be the first person to
receive his glorified resurrected body. This allowed that the rest of us
will also get a resurrected glorified body someday. New testament
Christians will get their glorified bodies at the rapture and old
testament saints at the second coming of Jesus at the end of the great
tribulation just before the millennium and the thousand year reign of
Jesus. On that glorious resurrection Sunday that was the feast of
firstfruits as Jesus rose from the grave, at the same time the priests
would have been waving the sheaves of grain of the people's offerings to
the LORD asking for God to accept the offering and bless the rest of the
barley harvest not realizing that Jesus, their Messiah and High Priest had
rose from the grave as the firstfruits for all those who would believe in
him. The priests missed out on the real firstfruits. (Hebrews 3:1
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the
Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;) Jesus overcame
death by being the firstfruits of resurrection guaranteeing that those who
are saved have also overcome spiritual death. (John 11:25-26 Jesus said
unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live:
26
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?)
Jesus asks do you believe he will give you everlasting life. Everyone must
answer this question for themselves and must answer yes Jesus is the
resurrection and life and believe if they want everlasting life. The feast
of firstfruits points to Jesus as our resurrection and life and points to
his second coming in the fall feasts that we can rejoice over and look
forward to. The spring feasts show Jesus in his first coming as our
Saviour and point to Jesus in the fall feasts as our King. 

Seven sabbaths and a day, or fifty days after the feast of
firstfruits, the Israelites were to celebrate the feast of harvest or
Pentecost. (Leviticus 23:15-16 ¶ And ye shall count unto you from the
morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the
wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:
16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty
days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.) The
Israelites were to do no work on Pentecost and were to offer another meat
offering. God gave the Holy Ghost to believers on Pentecost as his meat
offering to all true believers. Jesus ascended to heaven so the Comforter
who is the Holy Ghost could come and live in us. (John 14:26 But the
Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name,
he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you.) (I Corinthians 6:19 What? know ye not
that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye
have of God, and ye are not your own?
20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and
in your spirit, which are God's.) Jesus gave us the firstfruits of the
Spirit on Pentecost. (Romans 8:23 And not only they, but ourselves also,
which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.)
This verse shows how Christians should look to the day they get their
glorified, resurrected bodies that is now possible due to Jesus having
been our firstfruits.

The feast of firstfruits must go hand in hand with passover as the
passover represents the death of Jesus and the feast of firstfruits his
resurrection. You cannot have a resurrection without having a death.
Passover represents Jesus being slain and the feast of firstfruits Jesus
being raised up. The death of Jesus would have been in vain if he had not
rose from the grave, so you must have a resurrection with that death. You
cannot separate these two feasts. (I Corinthians 15:17 And if Christ be
not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.) Those who are
saved are still alive even though their physical bodies may be dead thanks
to Jesus being our firstfruits of resurrection. Thank God for the empty
grave. (Luke 24:1-7 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the
morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had
prepared, and certain others with them.
2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two
men stood by them in shining garments:
5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they
said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was
yet in Galilee,
7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men,
and be crucified, and the third day rise again.) Jesus is alive and well
and sits at the right hand of God the Father with the right hand denoting
prominence and therefore we can rejoice in our everlasting lives and look
to the things above in heaven and not focus on the things here on earth.
(Colossians 3:1 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which
are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.)

We as Christians celebrate Easter as Resurrection Day or the day
Jesus rose from the grave. We really should be celebrating the feast of
firstfruits as the true Resurrection Day. Some years Easter comes before
passover which destroys the connection for Christians witnessing to Jews
about the resurrection of Jesus as you have the resurrection on Easter
before having the death of Jesus on passover.

Jesus was bound in grave clothes when he was buried. This bounding is
symbolic of the barley bound in sheaves that would become the firstfruits.
(Mark 15:46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him
in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock,
and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.)

We see how Jesus as our firstfruits and High Priest ascended to
heaven after his resurrection that Sunday morning to offer his blood on
the heavenly altar as a firstfruits offering to God. This completed our
redemption and allowed us to have everlasting life for those who receive
Jesus as their Saviour. This was why Jesus told Mary Magdelene not to
touch him when she saw him by the tomb and thought he was the gardener.
(John 20:17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended
to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my
Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.) Mary could not
touch Jesus until he placed his blood on the heavenly altar. Then he
returned that day to see his disciples and then he could be touched.
Modern bibles change this to phrases such as "Do not cling to me" or
something similar and miss the connection. Mary could not even touch
Jesus, not just cling to him as she would have polluted him if she had
touched him due to her sin.  

For Jews or anyone who may be listening and are not saved, realize
that Jesus your Messiah died for yours and my sins on passover and rose
victoriously from the grave on the feast of firstfruits so that you might
have eternal life. Call upon Jesus today to save you. See how each Jewish
feast pointed to Jesus and thank God for sending his Son Jesus to save
each of us. Start celebrating the feast of firstfruits and all Jewish
feasts with a new understanding of what Jesus did for us and will bring us
in the future.
