Jesus in the Tabernacle

The tabernacle was first used by the Israelites while they were
wandering in the wilderness after God gave instructions to Moses on how to
build it. The Israelites continued to use the tabernacle until the first
temple was built by Solomon. The tabernacle and what is in it represents
Jesus and things dealing with Jesus. The tabernacle was meant to point the
Israelites to Jesus. The tabernacle is a copy of the real tabernacle in
heaven. Unlike the temple which was in a permanent location, the
tabernacle of the Israelites was made to be portable to travel with the
Israelites. It was basically a tent whereas the temple was a stone
building.

The tabernacle was the place where God dwelt among the Israelites,
who were God's chosen people. (Exodus 25:8-9 8 And let them make me a
sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.
9 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle,
and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.)
Verse 9 shows that the earthly tabernacle was a pattern of the real
tabernacle in heaven. This was why it had to be built exactly as God
commanded. It was also because the tabernacle and all that was in it
represented Jesus, so it had to be precise as not to destroy the
connection to Jesus. We see in the New Testament how Jesus was the living
tabernacle that became a man and dwelt among us. [John 1:14 And the Word
was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as
of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.] The word
dwelt is from the Greek word skenoo which is only used this one time in
scripture. It means to tent or tabernacle or dwell. It is showing how
Jesus tabernacled among the people just as he did in the tabernacle in the
old testament. God was giving us a clue in this verse showing Jesus was
our tabernacle for today. Revelation shows that after the new heaven and
earth is created, Jesus as our tabernacle will dwell with us once again
here on earth. (Revelation 21:3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven
saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with
them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them,
and be their God.)

The high priest offered sacrifices to God in the most holy place of
the tabernacle, the holy of holies. He did this once a year on the day of
atonement. He first made a sacrifice for himself and then for the people.
The day of atonement was on the tenth day of the seventh month on the
Jewish calendar. (Leviticus 16:29-30 ¶ And this shall be a statute for
ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month,
ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of
your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:
30 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse
you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.) The
sacrifices made before God made atonement for the people and their sins
for one year. The people's sins were covered by the blood of the animal
sacrifice, but not washed away as by the blood of Jesus. A bullock was
sacrificed for the sins of the high priest and a goat for the sins of the
people. A bullock is a castrated bull. The high priest represented Jesus
who is the High Priest in the real tabernacle in heaven. (Hebrews 3:1
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the
Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;) Unlike the
Israelite high priest who could not forgive the sins of the people, but
merely cover them with sacrificed animal blood, Jesus as our High Priest
washed away our sins with his sacrifice on the cross at Calvary. The
Israelite high priest was in charge of a tabernacle made by the hands of
men, whereas Jesus is High Priest of the heavenly tabernacle made by the
hand of God. (Hebrews 9:11-12 11 But Christ being come an high priest of
good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made
with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he
entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
redemption for us.) The Israelite high priest had to enter into the holy
of holies once every year to continually make sacrifices for the people
and their sins. Jesus as the High Priest only had to offer the sacrifice
of himself and his blood once. Verse 12 clearly shows this and says Jesus
made eternal redemption for us unlike the Israelite high priest.

I have already mentioned how the high priest had to perform
sacrifices in the tabernacle and how each year the high priest had to
offer a blood sacrifice. Jesus as the perfect sacrifice became the final
sacrifice for all time never to be repeated unlike what is done with the
Eucharist in the Roman Catholic Church which daily resacrifices Jesus.
(Hebrews 10:10-12 10 By the which will we are sanctified through the
offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the
same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat
down on the right hand of God;) The sacrifices in the tabernacle used
animal blood, but Jesus used his own blood. Many priests performed
sacrifices in the tabernacle which were temporary, but Jesus alone made
one sacrifice that was final.

The blood of Jesus is the only sacrifice that can wash away our sins.
The yearly sacrifice was offered on the mercy seat which was located on
the lid of the ark of the covenant which was located in the holy of holies
section of the tabernacle which was separated from the rest of the
tabernacle by a blue, purple, and scarlet vail. (Exodus 26:31 ¶ And thou
shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen
of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:) Blue represents
separation, in this case for God. As was everything in the tabernacle, the
ark of the covenant including the mercy seat where patterns or copies of
the real thing in heaven. Jesus after his resurrection went to heaven to
offer his blood on the heavenly mercy seat in order to complete his
redemption of man. This is why Mary Magdalene was not allowed to touch
Jesus before he had completed his mission so that she would not pollute
him with her sin. (John 20:17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am
not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I
ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.)
(Hebrews 9:23-24 23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things
in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
themselves with better sacrifices than these.
24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with
hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to
appear in the presence of God for us:) Ron Wyatt was a Christian man who
discovered the ark of the covenant in a tunnel directly under the cross
where Jesus was crucified. Many people try to discredit the man, but I
think he was led by God. Ron Wyatt said there was a crack in the rocks
directly under the cross where Jesus was crucified and went directly over
the mercy seat in the tunnel. This crack was caused by the earthquake
after the death of Jesus on the cross. (Matthew 27:51 And, behold, the
veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the
earth did quake, and the rocks rent;) Ron said the blood of Jesus flowed
down through the crack in the rocks and onto the mercy seat that was
buried beneath the cross. This is exactly what Jesus would have done.
Jesus always fulfilled the law to the letter. As High Priest, he placed
his blood on the earthly mercy seat of Israel for forgiveness of the
people's sins before completing the atonement for our sins by placing his
blood on the heavenly mercy seat.

The curtains that made up the tabernacle were of blue, purple, and
scarlet color. (Exodus 26:1 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with
ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with
cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.) I believe this
represented the blue of separation for God, the scarlet of the blood of
Jesus which washes away our sins, and the purple of the royalty of Jesus
as the King of kings. (Isaiah 1:18 Come now, and let us reason together,
saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as
snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.) (I Timothy
6:15 Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only
Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;) (Revelation 1:5 And from
Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the
dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us,
and washed us from our sins in his own blood,) The curtains were attached
by fifty gold taches to complete the assembly of the tabernacle. (Exodus
26:6 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains
together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle.) The gold
represented the deity of Jesus and the number fifty represents the Holy
Ghost and the fact that he dwells in believers who are a temple of the
Holy Ghost. (I Corinthians 6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the
temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are
not your own?) Boards were attached to the corners of the tabernacle with
silver sockets. Silver represented purity through Jesus Christ's
redemption. The tent was covered with ram's skins dyed red which
represented Jesus as our sacrificial passover lamb. (Exodus 36:19 And he
made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of
badgers' skins above that.) (I Corinthians 5:7 Purge out therefore the old
leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ
our passover is sacrificed for us:) Goat skins were also used in places as
were other places which used gold, silver, and brass.

The ark of the covenant was placed in the holy of holies section of
the tabernacle and could only be carried by Levitical priests. The mercy
seat was the lid on top and had a cherub placed on each end of the mercy
seat with each facing towards the seat. This is representive of God's
heavenly throne which has cherubim surrounding it. It is possible that
there were two cherubim since one of the meanings of the number two is
union and this was to point to the fact that man can reunite with God due
to sin through his Son Jesus if they call upon Jesus to save them. God
would appear here on the mercy seat to Moses. (Exodus 25:22 And there I
will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy
seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the
testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the
children of Israel.) The ark of the covenant was made of shittim wood and
covered with pure gold. (Exodus 25:10-11 10 ¶ And they shall make an
ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof,
and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the
height thereof.
11 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou
overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.) The
shittim wood represented Jesus as a man and the pure gold represented the
deity of Jesus. The ark represented Jesus as the God-man. (Philippians
2:6-7 6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
with God:
7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
servant, and was made in the likeness of men:)

The ark of the covenant contained the tables of stone or the ten
commandments, the budding rod of Aaron, and a pot of manna. (Hebrews 9:4
Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round
about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's
rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;) Because the ark of the
covenant contained the ten commandments, it was also known as the ark of
testimony. (Numbers 7:89 And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of
the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one
speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of
testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake unto him.) The ten
commandments represent the law and pointed people to realize they were
sinners in need of a Saviour. The ten commandments pointed people to their
need for Jesus. Jesus said he came to fulfill the law. (Matthew 5:17 ¶
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not
come to destroy, but to fulfil.)

Aaron's budding rod represented the high priest chosen by God. The
people of Israel said that they were as good as Aaron and why should he be
the only high priest and not someone from their tribe. God told Moses to
have the prince or leader of each tribe give Moses a rod. All twelve rods,
one from each tribe plus Aaron's rod were to be placed inside the ark of
the covenant and the one that budded was to be the high priest chosen by
God. Aaron's rod was the one that was budded as he was the man chosen by
God. God chooses his leaders, not man and this includes preachers.
(Numbers 17:4-5 4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the
congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.
5And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall
blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children
of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.) (Numbers 17:8 And it came to
pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and,
behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought
forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.) Notice that the
rod had buds, blossoms, and almonds. It had all the different stages of
growth. Normally all would be in the same stage or close to the same. This
budding rod not only showed God chose his man, not man, but the miraculous
power that God can bring life to a dead stick and in various stages of
growth. Jesus will also bring life to a dead stick (people) if they call
upon him to save them.

The manna was the food the Israelites ate during their time of
wandering in the wilderness. It represented Jesus as the bread of life who
came from heaven to be a man and fell from heaven each morning to the
people. The manna was contained in a golden pot since Jesus is God and
gold represents deity. (Exodus 16:15 And when the children of Israel saw
it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was.
And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you
to eat.) (John 6:35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he
that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall
never thirst.) The people had to gather it up to be able to eat it just as
a person must individually call upon Jesus as the bread of life for
salvation. The manna was white in color representing the purity of Jesus
as the sinless man and tasted like honey showing the sweetness of Jesus.
Honey also destroys disease just as Jesus does. (Exodus 16:31 And the
house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander
seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.) (II
Corinthians 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin;
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.)

The tabernacle also contained the sanctuary which was on the other
side of the holy of holies and was separated by the vail. This contained
the table of shewbread, the golden candlestick, and the altar of incense.
(Hebrews 9:2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the
sanctuary.) The table of shewbread was located on the north side of the
sanctuary. The table of shewbread was made of shittim wood and covered in
gold again representing Jesus as the God-man. The table contained the
shewbread eaten daily by the priests and represents Jesus as the bread of
life. It was replaced weekly on the sabbath and eaten daily as we need to
read God's word daily and keep it fresh in our lives and one needs to
attend church at least weekly. The table is where one eats. The shewbread
was only for the priests. Twelve loaves were placed on the table
representing the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles along
with the number twelve representing governmental perfection of Jesus that
will come during the millennium. There were also gold pans, dishes,
pitchers, and bowls. The golden candlestick was made of one piece of gold
and had six branches and seven candle holders. It was the only light
available in the sanctuary for the priests and represented Jesus as the
light of the world. (John 8:12 ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying,
I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in
darkness, but shall have the light of life.) Jesus is the only true light
and the only light that a person needs. We see again the gold of deity and
that God is one God in the fact that the candlestick is one piece. Seven
represents perfection or completeness just as Jesus is perfect and one is
complete if they receive Jesus as their Saviour. The priests burnt a
special sweet incense daily on the altar of incense. Jesus is sweet. God
would take the life of anyone who burnt anything else. God killed Nadab
and Abihu in Leviticus 10:1-2 for offering strange fire on the altar of
incense. The altar of incense was also made of shittim wood covered in
gold showing Jesus as the God-man. The horns on the altar of incense which
were on each top corner were sprinkled with blood from the sin offering on
the day of atonement. (Leviticus 10:1-2 1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of
Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put
incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he
commanded them not.
2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died
before the LORD.)

The tabernacle was surrounded by a courtyard which had a fence around
it. The fence helped people from accidentally touching the tabernacle as
only the Levites could touch the tabernacle. Sacrifices were done inside
the courtyard. The fence was made of curtains held together by brass.
Brass represents judgment as we must be judged for our sins before a holy
God. This is why the sacrifices were done. Only flawless animals were
sacrificed just as Jesus was flawless and perfect. The altar was made of
shittim wood covered by brass, again representing judgment. The offerings
were made on this altar such as meat, burnt, peace, and sin offerings. The
brass laver was where the priests washed themselves after making
sacrifices and purified them so they could enter the tabernacle. God will
only allow purity inside his tabernacle and in heaven.

The tabernacle was in three sections: the holy of holies, the
sanctuary, and the courtyard just as our bodies are three parts: spirit,
soul, and body. The tabernacle was reassembled after moving starting with
the holy of holies and then working outward. God also starts with the
conviction of a person's spirit and their need for salvation through
Jesus. This represented a person who would enter the courtyard which
represented entering the gate of Jesus and then sacrifice their will on
the altar [get saved] and get baptized in the wash basin. The outer court
was exposed to weather just as we encounter storms in the Christian life.
The outer court represented our body. After being saved and enduring
tribulation as a Christian they could enter the sanctuary which
represented the soul and a person trying to get closer to God. The person
could go to the altar of incense and pray now according to the will of God
and not their own will. The Christian enters the holy of holies when they
are ready to sacrifice their life for Jesus and spend eternity in heaven
with him. This is represented by the person's spirit. The three parts
represented salvation in Jesus and a person's path to it.

The Israelites encamped around the tabernacle and never moved unless
God directed them, just as we should never move without being directed by
God. God placed the twelve tribes in specific locations according to their
population with three on each side. The tribes of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali
were camped north of the Levites. The tribes of Judah, Issachar, and
Zebulon were on the eastern side of the Levites. Reuben, Simeon, and Gad
were south of the Levites, and Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin to the
west. When they encamped in this order they made a giant cross
representing the future death of Jesus on the cross and their true future
atonement. The directions also represent Jesus or a connection to him.
North represents death and Dan brought much idolatry and death to Israel.
This also represents the death of Jesus on the cross. East represents
Jesus Christ and his then future coming from the tribe of Judah which was
located on the east.

No chair was ever found in the tabernacle as the work of the priest
was never finished yet Jesus our high priest sits at the right hand of God
the father as he completed the work on the cross. (John 19:30 When Jesus
therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed
his head, and gave up the ghost.) (Hebrews 10:12 But this man, after he
had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of
God;) The tabernacle and everything in it was to point the Israelites to
the tabernacle of Jesus and the real tabernacle in heaven. (Acts 7:44 Our
fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had
appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the
fashion that he had seen.) (Hebrews 8:5 Who serve unto the example and
shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was
about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all
things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.) Jesus is to
be our tabernacle that we look to for everlasting life. If you are not
saved, call upon Jesus today.
