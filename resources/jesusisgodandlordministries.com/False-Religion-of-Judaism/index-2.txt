False Religion of Judaism

Many people do not realize that Judaism is a false religion as much
as Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, or the many other false religions. Judaism
is not the religion of the Israelites as mentioned in the old testament.
The Israelites that followed God's commands in the old testament were
following the true religion or true beliefs of God. This was continued by
Christianity. The Jews over time started changing what God commanded them
to do and as all religions started adding to it. Today it is a dead
religion that any Jew following it will end up in hell as much as a Muslim
following Islam. I often preach that we need to bless the Jewish people
and to pray for them and support them as this is what scripture commands
us to do. This is still true, but we also need to warn the Jews that their
religion is a dead religion and that it is not the same beliefs that God
gave to Moses. We are to support Israel, but that does not mean we condone
everything they do or the false beliefs of Judaism. Few preachers have the
courage to tell the truth about Judaism. Many just believe that
Christianity came from it. True Christianity came from the laws of Moses,
but never contained the false beliefs of Judaism. God never started
Judaism. Judaism is man's attempt to "improve" on what God did. Just as
the Israelites were not satisfied with God as their king but wanted a man,
the Jews were not satisfied with the worship that God gave them and made
their own religion which is Judaism.

Judaism is named after the nation of Judah which was named for one of
the sons of Israel. After king Solomon died the twelve tribes of Israel
were divided into two separate kingdoms. The ten northern tribes became
Israel and the two southern tribes of Judah and Benjamin along with the
Levites became the nation of Judah. Judaism became a distortion of the
true beliefs that God gave to the Israelites. The nation of Israel was
full of sin and was taken captive by the Assyrian empire and the people
were spread all over the world. Judah lasted for a little longer, but her
sin was just as worse if not even worse. She was taken captive by the
Babylonians for 70 years which would influence her beliefs.

By the time of Jesus the Jews had added much tradition to their
beliefs with tradition overriding what scripture said. A good example is
how the Pharisees had added many extra laws to the sabbath from what God
commanded. The sabbath had become a burden to the people rather than a day
of rest and worship of God. The Jews added the Talmud to the writings of
the old testament. Many of the traditions and false teachings of Judaism
come from the Talmud. There are actually two Talmuds. The main one is the
Babylonian Talmud which came about around A.D. 200. This is where most of
their beliefs come from. The second Talmud came about around A.D. 400 and
is known as the Talmud of the Land of Israel or the Jerusalem Talmud. Both
Talmuds contain both a Mishnah and a Gemara. These two Talmuds do not
agree in places which shows they are not inspired by God. Together these
two books make up what is known as the Talmud. The Talmud according to the
World Book Encyclopedia is "a collection of legal and ethical writings, as
well as Jewish history and folklore. It serves primary as a guide to the
civil and religious laws of Judaism. Orthodox Jews believe the laws in the
Talmud were given to Moses by God and passed down orally from generation
to generation." It was in 200 that these oral laws were written down as
the Mishnah. Later on scholars explained the Mishnah and their
interpretations were written down as the Gemara and these two books
together make up the Talmud. God warned about avoiding these Jewish
fables. (I Timothy 1:4 Neither give heed to fables and endless
genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is
in faith: so do.) (Titus 1:14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and
commandments of men, that turn from the truth.) (II Peter 1:16 For we have
not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the
power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his
majesty.) II Peter 1:16 shows true Christianity never came from Judaism.
One of the factors that brought about the Talmud was Jesus. As many Jews
and Gentiles turned to Jesus and got saved, the Jews who as a whole
rejected Jesus as the Messiah felt they needed to save their religion. The
Jews had already long been corrupting the beliefs with oral tradition of
which Jesus often condemned them over. It was due to this corruption by
the Pharisees and other leaders over time that they were blinded to
realize that Jesus was their Messiah. The Jews had made tradition of more
importance than what scripture said. Besides the Talmud the Jews have the
old testament which they refer to as the Tanakh with the first five books
of Moses (Genesis to Deuteronomy) as the Torah. Most Jews only read the
Torah and much of the rest is ignored except parts at certain times. Any
parts that show Jesus as the Messiah especially Isaiah 53 are ignored and
are not to be read. Today the Talmud is more important than the Bible.
Many of the traditions that God condemned the Jews over are contained in
the Talmud showing the Jews never learned. In Judaism with the Talmud and
specifically the Gemara, man's words have become greater than God's word.
The Jewish bible contains the same as our old testament except that we
divide it into 39 books and the Hebrew bible is made up of 24 books. They
combine I and II Samuel into one book and do the same to I and II Kings
and I and II Chronicles. Ezra and Nehemiah are combined as one book and
the twelve minor prophets as one book. 

We need to understand that today there are many Jews who are of
Jewish heritage, but are very secular and many consider themselves
atheists and do not belong to Judaism. These Jews are often very liberal.
The Jew Karl Marx started communism and many Jews are very liberal and
support the New World Order. Then there are Jews who say they belong to
the religion of Judaism. Judaism just like Christianity or Islam has
different sects or denominations. During the days of Jesus, you had
different groups from today such as the Pharisees and scribes, Sadducees,
Herodians, Zealots, Essences (who stashed the dead sea scrolls), and
Christianity which until the time of the destruction of the temple in AD
70 was considered a sect and was known as the Nazarene sect. (Acts 24:5
For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition
among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of
the Nazarenes:) The religion of the Jews was not referred to as Judaism at
that time, but just the Jewish religion and the people as Jews. Today
Judaism is made up of Orthodox Jews with a subgroup known as the
ultraorthodox. These Jews are the strictest Jews who try and follow all
the laws of the Talmud and will not even turn on a light switch on the
sabbath. They refuse to do military service. Some other subsects of
Orthodoxy Judaism are the Hasidic Jews who are very hard to reach for
Jesus. The Orthodox Jews highly follow the teachings of Rabbi Moses ben
Maimon better known as Maimonides and his teachings known as Maimonides 13
principles. Maimonides lived in the 1100's. His teachings have superseded
scripture. Orthodox Jews wear special clothing. Conservative Judaism is
not as strict as the Orthodox. They believe that oral law is divine and
that the rabbis can interpret both the written and oral law. Reformed
Judaism is often referred to as Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many
countries. Reformed Judaism was started in the 1800's and rejects most of
the ritual and ceremonial laws of the Torah. Reformed Judaism emphasizes
Jewish tradition. This sect makes up most Jews as most Jews are also
politically liberal. Reconstructionist Judaism is similar to reformed
Judaism but lets the community decide what observances to follow. This
shows how Jews do not obey scripture but make up their own rules. A small
amount of Jews belong to Humanistic Judaism which denies God but
emphasizes Jewish culture and history. These Jews obviously have forgotten
that it was God that provided that history. There are a few other small
groups. Messianic Jews are Jews who have received Jesus as their Saviour,
but consider themselves Jews and they still follow Jewish customs. They
are not recognized as part of Judaism by the Jewish religious leaders as
they deny Jesus and despise him even today. A few groups in between the
sects of the days of Jesus and today that no longer exist are the
Sephardic Jews and the Ashkenazi Jews.  

Jews worship in synagogues and the leaders are called rabbis. Jews
were never intended to have synagogues. God gave them first the tabernacle
and then the temple and worship was to have been done at the temple in
Jerusalem. As time went by especially after the diving of Israel into two
kingdoms then synagogues became important as the northern tribes were
forbidden from going to the temple in Jerusalem by the evil kings. The
Jews will rebuild the temple during the tribulation and will restart
animal sacrifices. Since the Jews have not had a temple since AD 70 and
cannot perform animal sacrifices to what they believed removed their sins,
they have made works as the way of salvation. All false religions have
works as the way to heaven. Jews are forbidden to mention the name of
Jesus or to learn about him. Jesus is Yeshua in Hebrew. Family members
will often punish another one who is caught reading the new testament or
talking about Jesus. When one gets saved they are usually shunned by the
rest of the family as a traitor to Judaism.

Judaism does retain some of the beliefs of Christianity such as the
worship of one God, the Genesis account of creation, and other stories and
beliefs. Many liberal Jews accept evolution. Judaism just like
Christianity is a monotheistic religion and both claim rightfully descent
from Abraham. Judaism differs in the rejection of the new testament as
well as in the rejection of the Godhead (trinity). Judaism denies Jesus is
God as well as being the Son of God and the Messiah. Judaism denies the
Holy Ghost is a person. Remember some of the Jewish believers in the old
testament rightfully believed the same as we do, but that Judaism is a
distortion of what God gave to the Jewish people and is a false religion.
Judaism accepts the old testament, the Talmud, various rabbis and
traditions for their beliefs, while rejecting the new testament. Judaism
has rejected some of the things in the old testament. Judaism agrees with
Christianity by believing man was created in God's image and man is fallen
due to Adam's sin and needs salvation. In Judaism sin is disobeying the
laws in the old testament. Remember the Pharisees added many manmade laws
as well. Salvation in Judaism is by one's works and obeying Biblical and
rabbinical laws and will also be by future animal sacrifices.

Judaism has not only added to God's word with the Talmud, but has
made tradition of more importance than the word of God. Judaism rejects
the new testament and Jesus and has minimized much of the old testament as
well. I mentioned how works have become the way of salvation and Jews look
forward to the day that the temple is rebuilt and animal sacrifices
restarted. Sacrifices will never save you, only the blood of Jesus.
(Hebrews 10:4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
should take away sins.) All false religions have work for their salvation.
Scripture says we are saved by grace through faith, not works. A person's
faith must be placed in Jesus, not themselves. (Ephesians 2:8-9 For by
grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the
gift of God:
9Not of works, lest any man should boast.) Most Jews in reality know very
little about what is in scripture (old testament) and most do not care to
know. The day will come at the end of the tribulation that the remaining
one third of Jews who are still alive will all be saved. (Zechariah 13:8-9
And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts
therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.
9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them
as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call
on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they
shall say, The LORD is my God.) Jews have little hope for salvation and
they only hope they will get to heaven. By trusting what God taught Moses
they could know they will go to heaven if they trust and believe in Jesus.
Judaism has distorted God's word so that today Jews have no assurance of
going to heaven. Scripture says that those who trust in Jesus as their
Saviour can know they will go to heaven. (I John 5:13 These things have I
written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may
know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the
Son of God.) Due to Judaism's hatred for Jesus they have intentionally
dropped years from their calendar. The Jewish calendar is supposed to be
based off of the date of creation yet many years were dropped so it would
not match up with Jesus. Their calendar in 2022 is the year 5778 when it
should be just under 6000. Many of the Jewish feasts have had customs
added to them by the Jews over the years that God never ordained. In
summary Judaism is a false religion as it adds to God's word (Talmud) as
well as removes from God's word (new testament) and salvation is by works
and Judaism rejects Jesus as her Messiah.  

The Star of David is the symbol used for Israel and Judaism and is on
the flag of Israel. The Star of David is made up of two triangles
overlapping with one pointing up that supposedly represents God and one
pointing down that supposedly represents man. This symbol is not from God
and God never gave it to the Jewish people to use. In fact God condemned
its use. This again shows that Judaism is a false religion. These verses
may be speaking of the symbol being used by the Jews or at least a similar
one. The star represented false gods worshipped by the Jews and their
neighbors. Solomon married many wives that worshipped these false gods.
Sometimes the Star of David is associated with Solomon which makes sense
as he had been influenced by false gods. The Seal of Solomon is believed
to have been nothing more than the Talisman of Saturn. Satanists and
Freemasons love Solomon. (Amos 5:26 But ye have borne the tabernacle of
your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to
yourselves.) (Acts 7:43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the
star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I
will carry you away beyond Babylon.) It does seem that God may be giving
us a clue that Solomon may have used the hexagram for sinful worship as he
collected the same amount of gold annually as the number of the beast in
Revelation. (I Kings 10:14 ¶ Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon
in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,)
(Revelation 13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count
the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is
Six hundred threescore and six.) I do not believe that it is a coincidence
that Solomon is connected to the mark of the beast. Remember the Roman
Catholic Church which will give us the antichrist uses the same symbol.
The papal mitre even has the symbol on it as do many Roman Catholic
churches and other things in Roman Catholicism. The Star of David is
nothing more than a hexagram which is used by Satanists, Luciferians,
witches, Freemasons, astrologers, New Agers, other occultists, and the
Roman Catholic Church whose pope will be the antichrist as well as by
Mormons and others. The fact that even the Roman Catholic Church uses the
Star of David shows it is not a Jewish symbol. No scripture backs up David
using it so by calling it the Star of David is just a way to deceive
people about the true origin and meaning of it. The Star of David is
essentially a double pyramid which is highly representative in Freemasonry
which is Satanism in disguise. Many secular Jews have been Freemasons or
belonged to other satanic organizations such as the Illuminati that are
working on bringing in the New World Order. The Star of David consists of
six points, six triangles, six sides of the hexagon and represents the
number of the beast which is 666. The six pointed star is always satanic.
Satanists use the Star of David to represent 666 so it is not speculation.
The Star of David is used by witches to call devils. In fact witches are
said to place a "hex" (curse) on people and this saying comes from
hexagram. Some Satanists have said it is necessary to have a hexagram
present in order to call forth devils. The horns of the Freemason god
Baphomet who represents Satan can be seen on the points of the top
triangle which points downward. I mentioned how the two triangles are
supposed to represent God and man. This is similar to in Freemasonry where
Baphomet points up and down and they say "as above, so below". This
references Satan, not God. Mystical Kabbalist Jews in the Dark Ages are
known to have used the Star of David. These Jews were into the occult. The
Jewish Rothschild family, of whom most were Satanists, has a long
connection with the New World Order and their family symbol is a red
hexagram and they are controlled by the Jesuits and they control much of
the world's finances. Israel today is secretly controlled by the Roman
Catholic Jesuits who are bringing in the New World Order and control the
world's wealth. This is one of the reasons for the Star of David on the
national flag as well as the fact that many of the Jewish leaders are
Freemasons and Illuminati. The Star of David is placed on Jewish
synagogues. This was supposedly done to match the Christian cross, but in
reality marks them as servants of Satan and Judaism as a false religion.

Because Israel and the Jews have rejected Jesus, God has blinded them
since the death and resurrection of Jesus until his second coming. (II
Corinthians 3:13-16 And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that
the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which
is abolished:
14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same
vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done
away in Christ.
15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their
heart.
16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken
away.) This does not mean that individual Jews cannot be saved as many
have, but the Jewish people as a whole are spiritually blind. They
rejected Jesus because they listened to their religious leaders and
followed tradition rather than the word of God in recognizing that their
Messiah was in front of them in Jesus. I plead with any Jews that may be
listening to search out the whole of scripture in the old and new
testaments and see how Jesus fulfilled all of the Messianic prophecies.
You may go to my website at www.jesusisgodandlordministries.com and look
under the section For Precious Jewish Souls for more information including
a listing of many of the prophecies fulfilled by Jesus. Precious Jewish
soul, you must realize that Judaism is a dead and false religion that will
not save you and being Jewish will not save you either nor your works or
sacrifice of animals or fulfilling the feasts. You must admit that you are
a sinner, we have all broken the ten commandments, and then realize that
you cannot save yourself and need a Saviour and that Saviour is Jesus.
Jesus was a Jew and one of you. He is not an evil man as Jewish religious
leaders have taught that you are to avoid. Only you will answer before God
for your decision, not your religious leaders, family, or friends as they
will answer for themselves. Call upon Jesus to save you now before it is
eternally too late. (John 3:16 ¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave
his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
but have everlasting life.)
