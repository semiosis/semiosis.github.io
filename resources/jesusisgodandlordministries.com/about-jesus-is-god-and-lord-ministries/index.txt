About Jesus is God and Lord Ministries

This ministry was started in 2019 by an ordained Baptist minister
with the first and foremost purpose to win souls for Jesus by telling them
about Jesus and who he us and what they must do to be saved and to show
that Jesus is God and Lord and to glorify Jesus Christ. (Proverbs 11:30
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is
wise.) For those who are saved, as Dr. Kent Hovind says, to motivate them
to read and study (these are not the same) God's word (King James Bible)
and to get them out there on the front lines winning souls for Jesus in
whatever gift God the Holy Ghost has given them (All true born again
Christians have a gift from the Holy Ghost) whether starting their own
website, starting a tract ministry as the founder of this ministry has (I
recommend Chick tracts), music ministry or whatever ministry God leads you
to serve him and win souls. Find something to do to enter the fight.
Everyone can pray or talk to people and tell them about Jesus. We are in a
spiritual battle with Satan and his followers. (Ephesians 6:12 For we
wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
spiritual wickedness in high places.)

The secondary purpose of this website and ministry is to be an online
church for those who are unable to attend for whatever reason it may be,
such as living in a persecuted nation where one does not have the freedom
to attend, one in bonds, illness, or whatever reason. For those who can
attend a God fearing church, they should. They may continue to learn from
this website as the Lord leads, but should not forsake assembling with
fellow believers if able to do so. (Hebrews 10:25 Not forsaking the
assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting
one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.)
Scripture study lessons, sermons, hymns and a King James Bible will be on
this website for people to study and learn God's word, so that they may be
saved, lead others to salvation and to grow in the word after they are
saved. (Once saved, always saved, though this does not give you freedom to
live in sin.) If one is saved from reading this website, please let me
know by emailing me at kevin@jesusisgodandlordministries.com. May God
bless those who truly seek out Jesus and those who serve God faithfully
every day on the front lines of this spiritual war.

This is a love site, not a hate site (just as the gospel is a love
message, not a hate message) , but is intended to bring people to the
saving knowledge of Jesus Christ by showing the errors of religions,
cults, or other false teachings. (Galations 4:16 Am I therefore become
your enemy, because I tell you the truth?) It is not intended to offend
anyone, but Jesus said the gospel will offend people. I would rather
offend people now and have them hate me (Jesus said the world will hate
those who stand for him) (John 15:18 If the world hate you, ye know that
it hated me before it hated you.) (I John 3:13 Marvel not, my brethren, if
the world hate you.) in the hope that they will turn to Jesus and be saved
before it is too late and spend an eternity in the lake of fire. We are
warned to be watchmen on the wall and warn the lost before it is too late
for them. If we warn them their blood is off our hands, but if not it is
on us. Let us obey God and warn man. That is what this ministry and
website is for. Ezekiel was a watchman for the Jews. Let us be a watchman
for the world and keep the blood off our hands.

Ezekiel 33:1-9

1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When
I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of
their coasts, and set him for their watchman:
3 If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and
warn the people;
4 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning;
if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own
head.
5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall
be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.
6 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and
the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from
among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require
at the watchman's hand.

7 ¶ So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of
Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from
me.
8 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou
dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die
in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
9 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he
do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast
delivered thy soul.

There are only two kinds of people in the world, saved and unsaved
(or lost). It does not matter what nationality you are, what language you
speak, what color you are, how rich or poor you are, if you are free or
not [slave or in prison] (only children of God are truly free, as the lost
are influenced by sin and Satan and belong to him), young or old, small or
great or any other division man tries to compare themselves with. Each and
every person ever born, must decide for themselves to follow Jesus or
Satan. Making no decision automatically makes you a follower of Satan
because of the sin nature we are born with. Ignorance is no excuse when we
all will stand before God. God has put it in our hearts that we need a
Saviour. (Romans 1:20) (Romans 2:15 Which shew the work of the law written
in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts
the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)) Man makes
divisions, but Jesus says we are saved or unsaved and nothing else
matters. Please choose today to be saved. It is the sincere pray and hope
of this ministry and website that all will be saved. Jesus wishes that
none should perish, but all repent. (II Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack
concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering
to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come
to repentance.)

This website is an ongoing work in progress and labor of love for
Jesus and the lost. It will be added to as the Lord leads me and provides
me the time. May this ministry and website honor and glorify our Saviour
the Lord Jesus Christ.
