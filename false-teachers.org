* I want to expose liars as I find them
** Justin Peters
Justin Peters persecuted Jesus in this video:

There's nothing wrong with either of these Bethel teachers teachings which Justin Peters has made a mockery of, and here are Scriptures to back up my position:

Saul was persecuting Jesus when Saul was persecuting Christians. In other words, Jesus takes it personally when Christians experience persecution.

*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209%3A4&version=ESV][Acts 9:4]]* - And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? (ESV)

About "forgiving" Jesus, it's about not bearing a grudge against Jesus for what His body has done, it is for our own good that we "forgive" and not bear a grudge:

*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2019%3A18&version=ESV][Leviticus 19:18]]* - You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD. (ESV)

*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203%3A15&version=ESV][I John 3:15]]* - Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. (ESV)

*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203%3A14&version=ESV][Colossians 3:14]]* - And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. (ESV)

*[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2011%3A2&version=ESV][II Corinthians 11:2]]* - I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. (ESV)
